  abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the relationship of the vocal tract dimensions and dental arches in participants with substitution of palatal approximant /j/ for the trill variant of /r/. Method: Cephalograms and dental casts of 60 native speakers of Arabic were used for comparison. The experimental group included 30 participants with substitution of /j/ for the trill variant of /r/ (17 males and 13 females, age ranged between 15–20 years, M ϭ 18.7 years, SD ϭ 1.27). The control group included 30 normal speakers (15 males and 15 females, age ranged between 15–20 years, M ϭ 18.3 years, SD ϭ 1.67). Both groups had class I occlusion. Result:The experimental group showed significantly shorter maxillary length, p Ͻ 0.05, and narrower vocal tract dimensions compared to the control group, p Ͻ 0.05.Tongue length (TGL) and height (TGH) and soft palate length (PNSP) and thickness (MPT) were statistically significantly reduced in the experimental group compared to the control group, p Ͻ 0.05. The distance between the hyoid bone and retrognathion or C3 was significantly shorter in the experimental group compared to the control group, p Ͻ 0.05. Inter-canine widths and dental arch lengths were significantly shorter in the experimental group compared to the control group, p Ͻ 0.05. Conclusion: The substitution of /j/ for the trill variant of /r/ is associated with altered dimensions of the vocal tract. These alterations may explain the residual articulation disorder during the production of the trilled /r/ compared to other sound classes that respond to speech therapy. Orthodontic and Maxillo facial surgery consultation might be needed when providing therapy to individuals with this particular articulation disorder.},

  abstract = {Contrary to what non-practitioners might expect, the systems of phonetic notation used by linguists are highly idiosyncratic. Not only do various linguistic subfields disagree on the specific symbols they use to denote the speech sounds of languages, but also in large databases of sound inventories considerable variation can be found. Inspired by recent efforts to link cross-linguistic data with help of reference catalogues (Glottolog, Concepticon) across different resources, we present initial efforts to link different phonetic notation systems to a catalogue of speech sounds. This is achieved with the help of a database accompanied by a software framework that uses a limited but easily extendable set of non-binary feature values to allow for quick and convenient registration of different transcription systems, while at the same time linking to additional datasets with restricted inventories. Linking different transcription systems enables us to conveniently translate between different phonetic transcription systems, while linking sounds to databases allows users quick access to various kinds of metadata, including feature values, statistics on phoneme inventories, and information on prosody and sound classes. In order to prove the feasibility of this enterprise, we supplement an initial version of our crosslinguistic database of phonetic transcription systems (CLTS), which currently registers five transcription systems and links to fifteen datasets, as well as a web application, which permits users to conveniently test the power of the automatic translation across transcription systems.},

Glottolog.org lists ‘Indonesian Bajau’ as a language spoken on the south-eastern coast of Sulawesi, glottocode indo1317 and ISO 639-3 bdl. Clifton (2010) claims the population of Bajau speakers is 700,000–900,000, with around 150,000–230,000 in eastern Indonesia (Sather 1997) and 92,000 in Sulawesi (Mead \&amp; Lee 2007). There are also Bajau-speaking populations in the Philippines and Borneo (Jun 2005); see Figure 1. Bajau is classified as a threatened Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian language (Simons \&amp; Fennig 2017). It has been proposed that the language originated in the Zamboanga-Basilan area in southern Philippines (Jun 2005 citing Pallesen 1985).},

Spanish in the Americas comprises several dialects well differentiated by variations in the lexicon, phonology and, more importantly, in intonational patterns. In Mexico 86,211,000 (88\% of the population) use Spanish as their first language, and a significant number of indigenous people have Spanish as their second language. The variety illustrated here is representative of the speech of the educated middle-class population from the metropolitan zone (three female and three male speakers in their 30s), which has as its center Mexico City, the most densely populated urban area in the country with more than 20 million people according to the Mexican National Census (INEGI 2010).},

  abstract = {Language documentation faces a persistent and pervasive problem: How much material is enough to represent a language fully? How much text would we need to sample the full phoneme inventory of a language? In the phonetic/phonemic domain, what proportion of the phoneme inventory can we expect to sample in a text of a given length? Answering these questions in a quantifiable way is tricky, but asking them is necessary. The cumulative collection of Illustrative Texts published in the Illustration series in this journal over more than four decades (mostly renditions of the ‘North Wind and the Sun’) gives us an ideal dataset for pursuing these questions. Here we investigate a tractable subset of the above questions, namely: What proportion of a language’s phoneme inventory do these texts enable us to recover, in the minimal sense of having at least one allophone of each phoneme? We find that, even with this low bar, only three languages (Modern Greek, Shipibo and the Treger dialect of Breton) attest all phonemes in these texts. Unsurprisingly, these languages sit at the low end of phoneme inventory sizes (respectively 23, 24 and 36 phonemes). We then estimate the rate at which phonemes are sampled in the Illustrative Texts and extrapolate to see how much text it might take to display a language’s full inventory. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for linguistics in its quest to represent the world’s phonetic diversity, and for JIPA in its design requirements for Illustrations and in particular whether supplementary panphonic texts should be included.},

It then considers how potential users of reference grammars can be identified in minority language contexts and how grammars can be structured in order to meet the needs of users who are native speakers of the language without being language specialists. The study next addresses the problem of content, considering both what to include and how to include it. In this section particular attention is paid to making metalinguistic and terminological choices, establishing grammatical norms and handling regional variations, deciding on the depth and breadth of grammatical description to include, selecting grammatical points to include, organizing the selected content optimally, choosing and integrating illustrative examples, and including key non linguistic information. Next follows a discussion of the various solutions arrived at in the case of writing a reference grammar for the Innu language. Among these figure the use of a multilevel approach designed to address the needs of a varied reading public, the selection of teachers as the target audience, the organization of content according to a hybrid structural-function approach, and the decision to write the grammar in a majority language. Although the challenges posed by the creation of minority language reference grammars vary substantially from one context to the next, it is hoped that many of the basic grammaticographie principles developed within the framework of this study will prove useful to others engaged in reference grammar writing in the case of endangered and poorly documented languages.},

  abstract = {This paper is a condensed presentation of the phonetics and phonology of Standard Italian, compared to the most prestigious local accents, viz. those of Florence, Milan and Rome. Historically based on the Florentine pronunciation, and traditionally identified with it, Standard Italian is nowadays used by trained speakers such as stage actors and (but less and less so) radio and TV speakers. The present paper aims at depicting the most salient features of Standard Italian, still a matter of primary reference in language courses, comparing them with the characteristic features of the three most prominent local varieties, with which the foreign learner is most likely to be confronted. All traditional (and sometimes widely debated) issues of Italian phonetics/phonology are addressed in the most ecumenical setting possible.},

Within the Belarusian language, the two main dialects are North Eastern and South Western (Avanesaǔ et al. 1963, Lapkoǔskaya 2008, Smolskaya 2011). Two additional regional forms of Belarusian can be distinguished: the Middle Belarusian dialectal group, incorporating some features of North Eastern and South Western dialects together with certain characteristics of its own, and the West-Polesian (or Brest-Pinsk) dialectal group. The latter group is more distinct linguistically from the other Belarusian dialects and is in many respects close to the Ukrainian language (Lapkoǔskaya 2008, Smolskaya 2011). The focus of this illustration is Standard Belarusian, which is based on Middle Belarusian speech varieties. For details on the phonetic differences across dialects, the reader is referred to Avanesaǔ et al. (1963) and Lapkoǔskaya (2008).},

  abstract = {Rhotics in many languages develop late and show clinically significant misarticulations. The English approximant and Spanish trill rhotics exhibit both a primary constriction along the palate and a secondary constriction in the pharynx. We speculate that the secondary constriction might be a cross-linguistic characteristic of rhotics and thus potentially a factor in delayed articulatory development/misarticulations. We describe an exploratory study analyzing rhotic tongue configurations in ultrasound videos from a small sample of native adult speakers of English, Malayalam, French, Persian and Spanish. Our findings confirm that rhotic sounds most subject to late development also involve tongue root movement towards a pharyngeal constriction, but this conclusion must remain tentative without further research. In the meantime, clinical strategies that include attention to primary and secondary constrictions should be explored for remediation of rhotic misarticulations across languages.},

This study presents a spectrographic analysis of syllable-initial rhotics as produced by ten speakers of Veracruz Mexican Spanish in a guided, semi-spontaneous speech task. Trills that show a reduction in the degree of lingual trilling usually contain an approximant phase following one or two lingual contacts, which we represent as [ɾɹ] or [rɹ] in narrow transcription. Intervocalic taps show both reduction and elision, but those with a measurable contact are short enough to maintain an acoustic difference with the longer allophones of /r/. Taken with recent studies of rhotics in Dominican Spanish, these findings suggest that the contrast between /r/ and /ɾ/ can be maintained in terms of overall segmental duration even when there is no difference in the number of lingual contacts.},

The major surviving varieties, Eastern, Central and Western Arrernte, Eastern and Western Anmatyerr, Southern and Northern Alyawarr each have several hundred to a thousand speakers, and are still being learned by many of the children, who grow up bilingual (in English) or multilingual.

  abstract = {A presente dissertação tem como principal objetivo apresentar uma descrição básica da implementação fonética de algumas oposições e categorias da fonologia da língua Tikúna. Para tanto, lançamos mão da análise de uma série de parâmetros da organização acústica dos sinais de fala produzidos sob condições controladas por 4 falantes nativos da língua, além de medidas derivadas a partir destes parâmetros.As categorias fonológicas submetidas à análise são as vogais orais, as consoantes obstruintes (oclusivas simples e africadas) e as consoantes soantes /r/ e /w/. O capítulo mais longo se dedica às vogais, no qual apresentamos os valores médios para cada um dos parâmetros de F1, F2, F3, duração e F0, e sua variação em função do contexto prosódico controlado pelo protocolo de elicitação de dados utilizado. Além de apresentarmos dados que atestam o efeito do contexto consonantal sobre a qualidade vocálica, também observamos alterações na manutenção de contrastes na região posterior do espaço vocálico em função do contexto prosódico. Apresenta-se evidências de que a oposição entre as vogais posteriores /u/ e /o/ é neutralizada em posição não-acentual na língua Tikúna. Um comportamento singular por parte das vogais anteriores /e/ e /i/ também é sugerido pelos dados, uma constatação recuperada no capítulo seguinte sobre as consoantes oclusivas. No capítulo sobre as consoantes obstruintes do Tikúna se apresentam dados relativos à alteração de parâmetros como duração da oclusão, presença ou não de vozeamento e VOT em função do contexto prosódico. Também são derivadas Equações de Lócus, que podem ser interpretadas como indicadoras do grau de articulação. A variação nas mesmas em função do contexto prosódico, do ponto de articulação e da categoria vocálica seguinte é também apresentada. No capítulo final, dedicado às consoantes soantes /r/ e /w/, apresentamos dados relativos à duração das oclusões, a manutenção de vozeamento, além de evidências que atestam alterações de modo de articulação. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ABSTRACT},

I consider both a diachronic/typological and an acoustic- phonetic point of view. The topic of consonant retroflexion has been widely investigated by Romance dialectologists as well as historical linguists, and by experimental phoneticians, but the convergence of the two sub-disciplines has been so far episodic. This dissertation aims at filling this gap, by exploiting the main resources of experimental phonetics with purposes of diachronic reconstruction.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a descriptive study of nasals and nasal harmony in Ikwere, an Igboid language of Nigeria. In the variety studied here, nasality is surface-contrastive in vowels but not in consonants. Nasality has the status of a morpheme-level feature which is either present or absent in each morpheme (root or affix). If present, it is predictably distributed across nonobstruent sounds by a system of nasal harmony which operates within the domain of the simple word, spreading nasality bidirectionally until blocked by an obstruent. The class of nasalizing sounds includes the nonexplosive stops ḅ and ’ḅ ~, confirming results of an earlier study showing these sounds to be nonobstruents (Clements and Osu 2002). The analysis brings to light some of the basic typological parameters that characterize nasal harmony in Ikwere, as well as an idiosyncratic restriction to the “phonological root”, a domain which excludes initial syllables in noun roots that are homophonous with prefixes in other words. The paper concludes with a summary and discussion of implications for the feature analysis and typology of stops.},

Twenty-four participants were recorded, 12 female, and 12 male. 38 unique stimuli were recorded in twelve randomized blocks. Participants were seated comfortably in an American Optical Co. Ultrasound data were recorded in B/M mode. B-mode was set to record the tongue along the mid-sagittal plane. Three parallel M-mode lines were set following the line of the anterior palate, so as to maximally intersect movement of the tongue tip through the alveolar region. stimuli was presented on an LCD monitor using PXLab in two groups of six blocks of 38 stimuli each, with a break between the two groups. the ultrasound audio and video were separated to allow for accurate acoustic boundary identification. It was observed that the M-mode information allowed for a relatively straightforward identification and distinction of the four kinematic variations of taps and flaps.},

This is paradoxical in view of the importance of data for phonetic research: from audio signals to the whole range of data acquired in phonetic experiments. The phonetic sciences stand to gain greatly from data availability: what is at stake is no less than reproducibility and cumulative progress. We will argue that a collective turn to Open Science holds great promise for phonetics. First, simple reflections on why access to primary data matters are recapitulated and proposed as a basis for consensus. Next, possible drawbacks of data availability are addressed. Finally, we argue that data curation and archiving are to be recognized as part of the same activity that results in the publication of research papers, rather than attempting to build a parallel system to incentivize data archiving by itself.},

EAS is most similar to Western Andalusian Spanish (WAS) and to Murcian Spanish, the latter spoken in the autonomous region of Murcia, immediately to the east of Andalusia, and it shares some phonetic traits with EAS, such as vowel lowering. Geographically, Eastern Andalusia includes the provinces of Almería, Granada, Jaén and Málaga, although the precise linguistic delimitation of this area is somewhat more complicated (Figure~1). The main criterion to differentiate EAS from WAS is the lowering or opening of vowels preceding underlying /s/ (Villena Ponsoda 2000). More detailed information on the differences between EAS and WAS can be found in Jiménez Fernández (1999), Villena Ponsoda (2000), Moya Corral (2010) and Valeš (2014). According to Alvar, Llorente \& Salvador (1973: map 1696), Cádiz and Huelva in the west are the only Andalusian provinces where vowel lowering before underlying /s/ is not found. As the geographical extent of this phenomenon is widely debated, it is difficult to calculate the precise number of speakers of EAS, but we can assert that this geolect is the native variety of Spanish of approximately 2,800,000 speakers if we take into account the figures from the last census of Andalusia in 2011 (Instituto de Estadística y Cartografía de Andalucía 2011).},

  abstract = {This paper reports on an acoustic analysis of the phonemic tap-trill contrast (/ɾ/-/r/) for first and second generation speakers of Mexican Spanish who live in the Chicagoland area. First, it is shown that speakers most commonly produce phonemic trills with a single apical occlusion, although there is much individual variation. Second, nearly all speakers realize the tap-trill contrast by means of segmental duration, and this is especially true for speakers who favor zero or one closures in the phonemic trill. These data suggest that heritage speakers make use of the limits of phonetic variation to the extent that phonological contrasts are intact in their grammar. The findings have implications for disentangling the sources of individual variation in heritage pronunciation. Specifically, we propose that between-speaker instabilities in rhotic production result more directly from an inherently variable speech signal than from the language contact situation.},

  abstract = {As Ladefoged (1999) points out in his description of American English, there is considerable diversity in the phonetic characteristics of English spoken in North America, such that the commonly used phrase ‘General American English’ is not entirely meaningful. The description of American English provided by Ladefoged was based on a southern California dialect. The purpose of this report is to augment that account with a brief description of southern Michigan speech patterns. According to Labov and colleagues (e.g. Labov, Yeager \& Steiner 1972, Labov 1994), southern Michigan, particularly in its urban areas, is part of a relatively large dialect region in the inland northeast United States called ‘Northern Cities’. According to Labov, the Northern Cities dialect cuts an irregular swath through a chain of cities in the inland northeast extending, roughly, from upstate New York (e.g. Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo), through northern Ohio (e.g. Cleveland, Toledo), southern Michigan (e.g. Detroit, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids), northwest Indiana (e.g. Gary, Hammond), northeast Illinois (e.g. Chicago, Rockford) and south-central Wisconsin (e.g. Milwaukee, Madison). Speakers from neighboring regions such as northwest Vermont, northwest Pennsylvania, and north-central/northeast Indiana appear to show some features of the dialect. Labov contends that the vowel shifts that characterize the Northern Cities dialect are observed in their most advanced forms in the largest urban areas of the region, such as Detroit, Buffalo, and Rochester.},

  abstract = {Two of the major problems with rhotics are: (1) rhotics, unlike most other classes, are highly resistant to secondary palatalization, and (2) acoustic cues for rhotics as a class have been elusive. This study examines the acoustics of Upper and Lower Sorbian rhotics. Dynamic measures of the F1-F3 and F2-F1 were recorded and compared using SSANOVAs. The results indicate there is a striking delay in achievement of F2 for both the palatalized rhotics, while F2, F1, and F2-F1 are similar for all the rhotics tested here. The results suggest an inherent articulatory conflict between rhotics and secondary palatalization. The delay in the F2 increase indicates a delay in the palatalization gesture. This is likely due to conflicting constraints on the tongue dorsum. There was also an overlap in the F2 and F2-F1 for both the uvular and alveolar rhotics. This suggests a strong acoustic cue to rhotic classhood is found in the F2 signal. The overall formant similarities in frequency and trajectory also suggest a strong similarity in the vocal tract shapes between uvular and alveolar rhotics.},

  abstract = {In the world's languages there is a close relationship among three lingual segment types: taps/flaps such as (c), trills such as (r), and stops such as (d). These segment types are phonetically similar, all involving contact between the tongue tip/blade and the region on/near the alveolar ridge. This dissertation is a typological survey of the phonetic and phonological relationships among these sounds using data from about 65 languages from a broad range of language families, including original phonetic data from about 15 languages. Several case studies are presented which demonstrate that intervocalic tapping of stops is widespread crosslinguistically. Phonetic data show that intervocalic tapping of trills is also widespread. These processes are analyzed as lenition in the temporal and spatial domains. A representation depicting this lenition process as the spreading of aperture is proposed. It is also shown that not all trills and taps that contrast in a language can be represented as a geminate/singleton pair, so an additional feature is needed to represent this contrast. Incorporating the generalization about the phonetic relationship between trills and taps, a phonetic length feature is proposed. In addition, the allophonic interaction between stops and trills in examined, revealing that in most cases an intermediate step of tap can be found. In three cases, the trill/stop alternation is phonologized to the extent that the intermediate tap is no longer evident. Also several languages with prestopped trills are examined, leading to the conclusion that they are trills that begin at the closure phase of the vibratory cycle and need no special representation.},

  abstract = {Russian maintains a contrast between non-palatalized and palatalized trills that has been lost in most Slavic languages. This research investigates the phonetic expression of this contrast in an attempt to understand how the contrast is maintained. One hypothesis is that the contrast is stabilized through resistance to coarticulation between the trill and surrounding vowels and prosodic positional weakening effects—factors expected to weaken the contrast. In order to test this hypothesis, we investigate intrasegmental and intersegmental coarticulation and the effect of domain boundaries on Russian trills. Since trills are highly demanding articulatorily and aerodynamically, and since Russian trills are in contrast, there is an expectation that they will be highly resistant to coarticulation and to prosodic influence. This study shows, however, that phonetic variability due to domain boundaries and coarticulation is systematically present in Russian trills. Implications of the relation between prosodic position and lingual coarticulation for the Degree of Articulatory Constraint (DAC) model, Articulatory Phonology, and the literature on prosodic strength are discussed. Based on the quantitative analysis of phonetic variability in Russian trills, we conjecture a hypothesis on why the contrast in trills is maintained in Russian, but lost in other Slavic languages. Specifically, phonological strategies used by several Slavic languages to deal with the instability of Proto-Slavic palatalized trills are present phonetically in Russian. These phonetic tendencies structure the variability of Russian trills, and could be the source of contrast stabilization.},

Grâce aux analyses auditives de 147 locuteurs écossais et aux analyses acoustiques fines de locuteurs de Dundee et de Kinross, l'extrême variabilité de /r/ a été confirmée dans cette variété d'anglais, y compris pour des locuteurs de la classe moyenne en style de discours contrôlé. Les rôles respectifs des facteurs linguistiques et extralinguistiques ont également été évalués. L'origine géographique et l'environnement phonologique notamment sont des facteurs déterminants pour la réalisation phonétique de /r/, et dans une moindre mesure les facteurs de l'âge et du genre des locuteurs. Ces résultats confirment que la variation est structurée et que le changement phonétique est en cours, avec une réduction progressive des rhotiques en anglais écossais.},

Francoprovençal enjoys varying levels of official status across these regions. In France, for example, Francoprovençal was only recognised by the Ministry for Culture and Communication in 1999 as a ‘language of France’, but it does not constitute one of the handful of regional languages protected by law that are permitted in the education system. Conversely, in the Aosta Valley (Italy), which enjoys an autonomous status, Francoprovençal is protected under Federal law, and is taught in schools (see Josserand 2003).},

Making use of first-hand materials from their fieldwork, Kobayashi and Tirkey analyze the complexities of the language in the grammar section. This book also contains transcribed and glossed texts, and a lexicon with more than 9,000 entries, and serves both as reference for linguists and learning resource for students},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of word-initial rhotic avoidance (WIRA) from a~typological point of view. Its first aim is to document WIRA cross-linguistically, based~on the examination of a sample of 200 languages designed by the WALS (Dryer and~Haspelmath 2013). This set of 200 languages has been surveyed in order to reveal~rhotic (and more generally liquid) phonotactic patterns in relation to word-initial~avoidance. On the basis of this survey, the paper identifies two types of WIRA: i)~phonological, or emic-WIRA; and ii) phonetic, or etic-WIRA. The first and most notable~result of this research is that 49\% of all languages containing at least one phonemic~rhotic exhibit some degree of emic-WIRA, i.e, they possess no word or very few words~beginning phonologically with at least one of their rhotics in their native lexicon. The~paper also examines how word-initial rhotics are adapted from a non-WIRA language~into a WIRA language. The loanword adaptation data suggest that WIRA is a recessive~feature because no language in the sample has been observed to develop WIRA due~to language contact (although one exception, Gascon, has been identified outside of~the 200-language sample). Finally, the paper proposes two new universals in relation~to WIRA: 1) if a language forbids /l/ word-initially, it also forbids /r/; 2) a rhotic segment~never occurs as the positional allophone of a non-liquid segment word-initially.},

To date, most sociophonetic work on consonants has made use of acoustic analysis to reveal unexpectedly subtle variation which is nonetheless socially indexical (e.g. Docherty and Foulkes 1999). However, some aspects of speech production are not readily recoverable even with a fine-grained acoustic analysis. New articulatory analysis techniques, such as ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI), allow researchers to push the boundaries further, identifying seemingly covert aspects of speech articulation which pattern with indexical factors with remarkable consistency. One such case is postvocalic /r/ variation in Central Scotland.},

They are both bilingual and switch regularly between Creole and French. The main speaker (AD) relates a recent trip to Singapore and Malaysia with her family in an extremely fast-speech rate, devoid however of an undue number of elisions or assimilations. The excerpt includes a wide variety of linguistic traits typical of Mauritius French, most of which can be attributed to Creole influence: absence of determiners, absence of prepositions à and de, a specific use of the preposition à. The phonological system of the speaker is characterized by the presence of four nasal vowels, the weakening of the rhotic in coda position, and the systematic simplification of obstruent + liquid clusters.},

  abstract = {Phoneticians typically distinguish three principal sub-disciplines within phonetics: these are concerned with how speech is produced, the nature of the sound itself, and how a human being reacts to speech stimuli. These first two areas are commonly referred to as articulatory (or physiological) phonetics and acoustic phonetics. The third encompasses auditory and perceptual phonetics; that is, it concerns both the way that the human auditory system works and the effects of various levels of further processing in the brain, in which a speaker's linguistic knowledge and experience play an important role. It is frequently difficult to separate auditory and perceptual effects since their investigation commonly relies on overt responses collected from listeners in which the sum of both kinds of processes is necessarily reflected.A phonetic research project, whether in the field or in the laboratory, may be directed at investigating articulatory, acoustic, or auditory/perceptual facts alone. However, many studies consider the relationship between articulatory or auditory/perceptual facts and the acoustic layer which mediates between them. A naïve native speaker's sub-conscious phonetic knowledge about his or her language concerns only production and perception, and not acoustic properties, nor the strictly auditory processes which transform the acoustic signal. However, the articulatory organization of speech must succeed in encoding information in acoustic form, and the perceptual apparatus must succeed in extracting the information from the acoustic signal. Because a good deal is known about articulatory/acoustic relationships, an examination of acoustic patterns can provide indirect information on articulation.},

Method               A cross-linguistic review was undertaken of 60 articles describing 64 studies of consonant acquisition by 26,007 children from 31 countries in 27 languages: Afrikaans, Arabic, Cantonese, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Haitian Creole, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Jamaican Creole, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Maltese, Mandarin (Putonghua), Portuguese, Setswana (Tswana), Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Turkish, and Xhosa.                                         Results               Most studies were cross-sectional and examined single word production. Combining data from 27 languages, most of the world's consonants were acquired by 5;0 years;months old. By 5;0, children produced at least 93\% of consonants correctly. Plosives, nasals, and nonpulmonic consonants (e.g., clicks) were acquired earlier than trills, flaps, fricatives, and affricates. Most labial, pharyngeal, and posterior lingual consonants were acquired earlier than consonants with anterior tongue placement. However, there was an interaction between place and manner where plosives and nasals produced with anterior tongue placement were acquired earlier than anterior trills, fricatives, and affricates.                                         Conclusions               Children across the world acquire consonants at a young age. Five-year-old children have acquired most consonants within their ambient language; however, individual variability should be considered.

The endonymic language name Seenku [               s               ɛ̃́ː-               k               u               ̂] (also spelled on               Ethnologue               as Seeku) literally means ‘thing of the Sɛ̃ː ethnicity’, but it is widely known to outsiders as Sembla (variant spelling Sambla), which doubles as an exonym for the ethnicity. Seenku has two primary dialects, Northern and Southern, spoken in villages approximately 40 km west of Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso (see map in Figure 1). This study focuses on the more populous southern dialect, particularly the variety spoken in and around the large village center of Bouendé (local name [ɡ͡               b               e               ́               n               e               ́-ɡ               u               ̃̏]), with a population of approximately 12,000 speakers; the Northern dialect, spoken around the village center of Karangasso (local name [               t               ə               m               i               ̂]), has a population of approximately 5000 speakers and was the subject of a sketch grammar (Prost 1971).

Though ABN is a               dialect               rather than an               accent               (Wells, 1970:231), its status is comparable to that of the RP accent of English since it is essentially a social variety only loosely associated with a particular geographical area. ABN speakers are to be found in greatest numbers throughout the Western provinces (i.e. Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland and Utrecht) and particularly in the annular               Randstad               conurbation linking the towns of Rotterdam, The Hague, Amsterdam and Utrecht; but ABN is to be heard from the upper socio-economic classes all over the Netherlands, and is also looked to as a standard in the Dutch-speaking regions of Belgium.},

This variety may also be referred to by its autoglossonym ‘Biarnés’ though the French term is the most widely used designation for the regional language. The number of Gascon speakers in south-western France increases steadily from north (Bordeaux) to south (the Pyrenees) and because Béarn is the area of linguistic Gascony with the highest recorded number of Gascon speakers (Moreux 2004), Béarnais may be considered the principal surviving dialect of Gascon, though other surviving dialects, such as ‘Gascon de Chalosse’, and ‘Landais’, are still spoken and written.},

Bloomfield 1933), but may involve gradual changes in the relative strength of primary and secondary articulations of the rhotic, as hypothesized much earlier by Jespersen (1889). Santerre’s study also supports Jespersen’s claim that a uvular fricative/approximant [ʁ] develops earlier in the dorsalization process, while the uvular trilled [ʀ] appears later as a reinforced variant of this fricative/approximant [ʁ], probably on social and communicative grounds. Santerre’s study of a single Montreal informant was conducted in the years 1970 at a time when a radical evolution from apical to dorsal articulation was under way in that city – an evolution well documented in a series of sociolinguistic studies (cf. Clermont \& Cedergren 1979; Sankoff \& Blondeau 2007), which conclude that this development is strongly conditioned by social factors and represents the spread across the linguistic community of a socially prestigious norm. The change observed by Santerre involves a classic form of lenition in syllable-final position that need not have been triggered by social factors. On the other hand, and contrary to implicit claims in Jespersen’s hypothesis, the dorsalization in other contexts does not develop at the same pace. One may hypothesize that dorsalization normally begins in word-final or preconsonantal position and is later generalized elsewhere, a process that might be sensitive to social factors. Imperfect learning by children during the early stages of acquisition – not examined in this article – may have been another factor responsible for the rapid spread of dorsalization in Montreal, as hypothesized by Passy (1891a) for similar changes in Europe, who argues that the child’s immature uvular rhotic, normally abandoned in the later stages of acquisition, may be retained when it becomes socially valued in the community.},

Phonemes are contrastive phonological units, and allophones are their various concrete realizations, which are predictable from phonological context. While phonemic representations are language specific, phonetic representations (stated in terms of (allo)phones) are much closer to a universal (language-independent) transcription. AlloVera allows the training of speech recognition models that output phonetic transcriptions in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), regardless of the input language. We show that a “universal” allophone model, Allosaurus, built with AlloVera, outperforms “universal” phonemic models and language-specific models on a speech-transcription task. We explore the implications of this technology (and related technologies) for the documentation of endangered and minority languages. We further explore other applications for which AlloVera will be suitable as it grows, including phonological typology.},

Emper is a pocket of fertile country partly enclosed in a loop of the River Inny and situate some eleven or twelve miles to the north-west of Mullingar. The population, fluctuating about two hundred souls, is composed mostly of farmers and farm labourers. They are engaged in mixed farming, that is tillage, stock-raising, and dairying; and are a settled community in that the farms in most cases have been occupied by the same families for generations. It is difficult to say at what date exactly the people of Emper ceased to speak Irish and became English speakers. The evidence is scanty and entirely oral, yet sufficient to warrant the conclusion that at some time after the middle of the eighteenth century, and certainly before 1800, Emper had become English speaking. The findings and conclusions below are based on my own (dialect) pronunciation and my memory of auditory observation of the speech of the older stratum of the inhabitants, and especially of those born before 1900. This is my vernacular speech and I have never lost touch with it.},

The language is diglossic, with the formal register used in written media and orally in formal settings. Colloquial Malayalam, for which there is no standard orthography, varies by region and social community (Asher \& Kumari 1997). The speech illustrated below is representative of the variety spoken by the Namboodiri subcaste of Brahmins in and around Kochi, a city in central Kerala. The Namboodiri subcaste was traditionally a land-owning priestly class, and until relatively recently, the community was very insular. Consequently, the dialect differed from standard Malayalam as it is spoken today; this is discussed in some detail in U. Namboodiripad (1989, personal communication).},

  abstract = {Isthmus Zapotec (autoglossonym: [dìʤàˈzàˑ]) is the common name used for a variety of Zapotec (Otomanguean family) spoken on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, Mexico (Suárez 1983: xvi; Campbell 1997: 158). It is now officially listed by the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI 2008) as ‘zapoteco de la planicie costera’ (‘coastal plain Zapotec’) to distinguish it from other varieties of Zapotec spoken on the Isthmus. It is the mother tongue of many inhabitants of various cities and towns, as well as many smaller communities (INALI 2008), with some lexical, syntactic and phonetic variation between towns only a few kilometers apart. The ISO 639-3 code for this variety is zai. Since the most recent census figures do not separate out the varieties of Zapotec, and have not done so reliably when attempted, official statistics as to the number of speakers of Isthmus Zapotec are not available. (The               Ethnologue               (Lewis 2009) cites the 1990 census as listing 85,000 speakers; that figure must have been an interpretation of other statistics in the census.) INALI (personal communication, September 2008) estimates the current number to be about 104,000. In the city of Tehuantepec, the language is no longer widely used. In certain other locations, including Juchitán de Zaragoza, Spanish is becoming the dominant or the only language spoken by many people born after about 1990, although Zapotec is dominant in many outlying towns, including San Blas Atempa. Mature speakers have remarked that young people who are not fluent do not use tones correctly. Isthmus Zapotec has had active writers, including poets and novelists, since the first half of the twentieth century, well before an orthography was officially established (               Alfabeto popular               1956), but reading and writing of the language are still not taught in schools in the region.},

It turns out that there are more apical [r]s in dialects than in French, more so in a syllable onset or an internal coda than in a word-final position, and more so in elderly speakers than in younger ones. By contrast, we did not find any apical [r] in the regional French varieties of speakers under 65 years old. Faced with this situation, we offer some elements of discussion about the interface between phonology and sociolinguistics.

  abstract = {Cette thèse comporte deux volets principaux : elle présente, d’une part, une réflexion sur la prononciation de l’anglais en Écosse et offre, d’autre part, une analyse de divers phénomènes segmentaux à partir d’une enquête sociophonétique menée à Ayr sur un corpus oral de locuteurs contemporains. La réflexion générale analyse les rapports entre anglais standard et écossais à la fois du point de vue diachronique et synchronique. Nous fournissons une description détaillée du Scottish Standard English (SSE) et, en particulier, d’un ensemble de processus morpho-phonologiques désigné par le terme «Règle de la Longueur Vocalique Écossaise» («Scottish Vowel Length Rule»). L’examen de cette «règle» constitue l’axe le plus important de nos recherches avec pour objectif une possible amélioration des modèles descriptifs et phonologiques de ce phénomène. Le cadre empirique de notre étude est constitué par le projet linguistique PAC (« La Phonologie de l’Anglais Contemporain ») fondé sur une méthodologie labovienne classique composée de divers échelons stylistiques du langage observé. Les données ainsi recueillies sur 12 locuteurs nous permettent d’explorer du point de vue sociolinguistique la variété de l’anglais parlé à Ayr et d’offrir une analyse phonétique approfondie des variables étudiées. Les mesures acoustiques effectuées nous ont permis d’identifier une variation de la durée vocalique des phonèmes / i u ai / chez les locuteurs de notre corpus en fonction de la structure morphologique et de l’environnement segmental. Cette variation s’est en revanche révélée absente pour les voyelles / e a o ɔ ɪ ɛ ʌ au ɔi /, ce qui confirme les résultats de certains travaux antérieurs. L’influence du voisement du segment consonantique suivant la voyelle sur la durée de celle-ci n’a pas pu être mise en évidence de manière catégorique. Sur le plan théorique, la question de la longueur (ou bimoraïcité) qui, pour nombre de spécialistes, constitue l’épine dorsale de la phonologie de l’anglais est au centre des préoccupations de la thèse. Bien qu’il soit souvent nié que la longueur soit pertinente dans les accents écossais, nous proposons de continuer à diviser les voyelles en deux sous-ensembles : longues et brèves. Néanmoins, la classification que nous avançons à partir de notre étude expérimentale ne correspond pas exactement aux classifications traditionnelles.},

Furthermore, it suggests that on the one hand, Tehrani-Persian speaking men and women's rhotic production patterns with those of Arabic societies as men favor rhotics with more complex articulations. On the other hand it questions whether the behavior of Tehrani-Persian speaking men and women conforms to established sociolinguistic norms regarding prestige and gender.},

Specifically, we probe the statistical characteristics of the /r/ vs. /rr/ contrast across prosodic positions from the perspective of both the speaker and the listener. We measure trills in 24 different Arop-Lokep words, so the resulting data are quite robust and give an excellent idea of the variation inherent in the language. A novel finding is that both lengths of trill consist of more apical contacts word-initially than intervocalically. The scope of this work is unprecedented in that no previous instrumental study has examined both initial and medial geminate trills in the same language.},

  abstract = {This is an electropalatographic and acoustic study of the production and coarticulatory characteristics of the alveolar tap /J/ and the alveolar trill /r/ in Catalan VCV sequences. The finding that /r/ involves more closure retraction, more predorsum lowering and less apico-predorsal coupling than /J/ suggests that the two consonants are realized by means of different lingual gestures. Moreover, in comparison with the tap, the trill exerts larger and longer effects on the adjacent vowels and is less sensitive to vocalic effects. This suggests that the tongue body is more constrained for /r/ than for /J/. The finding that the lingual gesture for a consonant (/r/) overrides the lingual gesture for an adjacent vowel (/i/) when the two segments are highly constrained and antagonistic is supportive of a view that consonantal production is more precisely controlled than vowel production. The tap and the trill also differ with respect to the direction of VCV coarticulatory effects: on the one hand, in /VrV/ sequences, anticipatory consonant and vowel coarticulation is predominant; on the other, in /VJV/ sequences, vocalic coarticulation is predominantly carryover, whereas consonantal coarticulation is mainly anticipatory. These patterns of coarticulatory behavior are accounted for in terms of gestural production mechanisms and biomechanical properties of the lingual articulators. Differences in articulation and coarticulation between /r/ and /J/ suggest that the trill is not a geminate correlate of the tap.},

Many speakers are also fluent in Bislama (an English-lexifier creole spoken in Vanuatu), one of three official languages. A dialect of Tamambo spoken on the eastern half of the island is now almost extinct, the main phonetic differences from the western dialect being the lack of prenasalized stops and labialized consonants, and the short articulation of vowels. Previous phonetic work on Tamambo is limited to a descriptive grammar of the language (Jauncey 1997).},

But contemporary ‘mainstream Italian’ – not following the standard in all respects – appears to be a variety under construction by speakers wishing to give themselves a national appeal, a process driven by the media and by workplace mobility. Our speaker is representative of this group. She is a woman in her thirties who was brought up in a middle-class household in Rome, and has travelled extensively in Italy and abroad. She aims at a cultivated accent with no strong regional features, sometimes called a ‘RAI’ accent (RAI /rai/ is the national broadcaster). The style she uses is a somewhat coloured ‘storytelling’ style.},

It further concludes that /ʎ/ is for all intents and purposes extinct, and that the stigmatized allophones of /f/ and /l/, as well as a non-stigmatized allophone of /b/, have been largely abandoned.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the argument-coding system of Mosetenan, a small language family spoken in the Bolivian Amazon. While there is no case marking on nouns, all coding of arguments is found in the cross-reference ending of verbs. Intransitive verbs are marked for the gender of their subjects, except for the first-person plural inclusive, which has a marker, -ja’, that does not indicate the gender of the subject. Transitive cross-referencing is more complicated. It is a layered system that combines the grammatical relation of the participant (S, A, or O) with the person (1, 2, 3) and number (singular and plural). Again, the forms of first-person plural inclusive subjects are unique. The second most important forms are third-person objects, which appear before any of the speech-act participants (SAP). I analyze the Mosetenan system, discussing how language contact can shape the general outline of an argument-coding system by the introduction of a new category such as an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first-person plural.},

More recent studies Stolarski 2011; Savu 2011, 2012 consider and argue that the tap is actually comprised of two vowel-like elements flanking this small constriction. After presenting the argument leading to this conclusion and briefly discussing the quality of the tap\&rsquo;s vocoids as shown through phonetic experiments, I approach the implications of this sound having the aforementioned structure. Specifically, I address the consequences for the status of syllabic /r/ in Macedonian and the different perception of /CɨrC/ sequences by speakers of Romanian and Slavic languages with syllabic /r/. In addition to this, I show how this structure of the tap suggests a possible phonetic account for vowel-rhotic metathesis between consonants as the migration of the constriction on a vocalic continuum provided by the tap and the full vowel.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates the role of phonetic biases and systemic effects in the  actuation of sound change through computer simulations and experimental  methods. Phonetic biases are physiological and psychoacoustic constraints on  speech. One example is vowel undershoot: vowels sometimes fail to reach their  phonetic targets due to limitations on the speed of the articulators. Phonetic biases  are often paralleled by phonological patterns. For instance, many languages  exhibit vowel reduction, a phonologised version of undershoot. To account for  these parallels, a number of researchers have proposed that phonetic biases are  the causal drive behind sound change. Although this proposal seems to solve  the problem of actuation, its success is only apparent: while it might be able  to explain situations where sound change occurs, it cannot easily explain the  lack of sound change, that is, stasis. Since stability in sound systems seems to  be the rule rather than the exception, the bias-based approach cannot provide  an adequate account of their diachronic development on its own.  The problem of bias-based accounts stems from their focus on changes affecting  individual sound categories, and their neglect of system-wide interactions.  The factors that affect speech production and perception define an adaptive  landscape. The development of sound systems follows the topology of this landscape.  When only a single category is investigated, it is easy to take an overly  simplistic view of this landscape, and assume that phonetic biases are the only  relevant factor. It is natural that the predicted outcomes will be simple and deterministic  if such an approach is adopted. However, when we look at an entire  sound system, other pressures such as contrast maintenance also become relevant,  and the range of possible outcomes is much more diverse. Phonetic biases  can still skew the adaptive landscape towards themselves, making phonetically  natural outcomes more likely. However, their effects will often be countered by  other pressures, which means that they will not be satisfied in every case.  Sound systems move towards peaks in the adaptive landscape, or local  optima, where the different pressures balance each other out. As a result, the  system-based approach predicts stability. This stability can be broken by changes  in the pressures that define the adaptive landscape. For instance, an increase or  a decrease in functional load or a change in lexical distributions can create a  situation where the sound system is knocked out of an equilibrium and starts  evolving towards a new stable state. In essence, the adaptive landscape can  create a moving target for the sound system. This ensures that both stability  and change are observed. Therefore, this account makes realistic predictions  with respect to the actuation problem.  This argument is developed through a series of computer simulations that  follow changes in artificial sound systems. All of these simulations are based on  four theoretical assumptions: (i) speech production and perception are based  on probabilistic category representations; (ii) these category representations  are subject to continuous update throughout the lifetime of an individual; (iii)  speech production and perception are affected by low-level universal phonetic  biases; and (iv) category update is inhibited in cases where too many ambiguous  tokens are produced due to category overlap. Special care is taken to  anchor each of these assumptions in empirical results from a variety of fields  including phonetics, sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics. Moreover, in order  to show that the results described above follow directly from these theoretical  assumptions and not other aspects of these models, the thesis demonstrates  that exemplar and prototype models produce the same dynamics with respect  to the observations above, and that the number of speakers in the model also  does not have a significant influence on the outcomes.  Much of the thesis focuses on rather abstract properties of simulated systems,  which are difficult to test in a systematic way. The last chapter complements  this by presenting a concrete example, which shows how the simulations can  be linked to empirical data. Specifically, I look at the effect of lexical factors on  the strength of contextual effects in sound categories, using the example of the  voicing effect, whereby vowels are longer before voiced obstruents than they  are before voiceless ones. The simulations implemented in this chapter predict  a larger effect in cases where a given vowel category occurs equally frequently  in voiced and voiceless environments, and a smaller difference where one of the  environments dominates the lexical distribution of the vowel. This prediction is  borne out in a small cross-linguistic production experiment looking at voicingconditioned  vowel length patterns in French, Hungarian and English. Although  this is only one of many predictions that fall out of the theory of sound change  developed in this thesis, the success of this experiment is a strong indication  that the research questions it brings into focus are worth investigating.},

  abstract = {A hundred years from now a large number of presently spoken languages will no longer be viable means of communication, and the distinctive sounds that they contain will have disappeared. Of the nearly seven thousand languages in the world listed by Grimes (1992), about ten per cent are spoken by around a thousand people or less. As the speakers of these languages grow old, and their children go to schools in which the main languages of the country predominate, phoneticians will no longer have access to the wide variety of sounds currently in use. Toda, a language spoken by about a thousand speakers in the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India, has some unusual sounds that will probably not exist in our great grandchildren's times. Among them are the six trills which this paper will describe. Tongue tip trills occur in about one third of the world's languages (Maddieson 1984). None of the languages in Maddieson's sample has two contrasting apical trills without secondary articulations, although they have been reported in Malayalam (Ladefoged 1971). To the best of our knowledge only Toda has three contrasting trills; and almost certainly no other language has surface contrasts between palatalized and non-palatalized versions of three lingual trills. Toda is a rich source for trill-seeking phoneticians.},

In our paper, we address this question and examine how speakers organize into consistent groups of allophones the array of /r/-variants that are used in South-Tyrol Italian (STI). In addition, we discuss that this process of grouping is based on two intertwining sources of variation: the linguistic source and the socio-indexical source. We argue that the indexical dimension is not disconnected from the linguistic one, but it contributes in an essential way to its structuring.Our investigation is based on a sample of two thousand tokens of /r/. These occurrences are extracted from a corpus that includes the (semi)spontaneous productions of 14 Italian-German bilingual speakers. The analysis concerns the identification of possible relationships among the allophones with respect to (a) distributional, (b) stylistic and (c) biographical factors. Data are analyzed using a multivariate exploratory technique, namely the multiple correspondence analysis approach. The results clearly show how the aggregation of indexical and linguistic factors determines the emergence of two different allophonic subsystems, that is the Italian of Italian-dominant speakers (STI-i) and the Italian of German-dominant speakers (STI-d).},

Several papers also include comparisons with singleton rhotics and/or /l/ as a singleton or in clusters. The studies are part of a larger investigation that uses similar methodologies across languages in order to enhance crosslinguistic comparability (Bernhardt and Stemberger, 2012, 2015). Participants for the current studies were monolingual preschoolers with typical or protracted phonological development who speak one of the following languages: Germanic (Icelandic/Swedish); Romance (Portuguese/Spanish); Slavic (Bulgarian/Slovenian) and Finno-Ugric (Hungarian). This introductory paper describes characteristics of taps/trills and general methodology across the studies, concluding with predicted patterns of acquisition. The seven papers that follow are in a sense the ‘results’ for this introduction. A concluding paper discusses major findings and their implications for theory, research and clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Dutch is a language spoken by about 20 million people in the Netherlands and Belgium. This region is not only characterised by a complex dialect situation, but also by the use of two institutionalised varieties of the Standard language: Netherlandic Dutch is spoken in the Netherlands and is documented in Collins \& Mees (1982), Mees \& Collins (1983) and Gussenhoven (1999), while Belgian Dutch is spoken in the northern part of Belgium (Flanders) by approximately 6 million speakers. This variety is the same as what is commonly referred to internationally as ‘Flemish’. However, the term ‘Flemish’ is avoided here since it erroneously suggests that this language is different from the one spoken in the Netherlands: the lexical and syntactic differences between the two language varieties are very small. Nevertheless, there are significant phonetic differences as well as substantial regional variability within the two speech communities.},

Together with Umbuygamu (Ogilvie 1994, Sommer 1998, Verstraete 2017) and Rimanggudinhma (Godman 1993), Lamalama forms the Lamalamic subgroup of Paman languages (Laycock 1969, Rigsby 1997, Verstraete 2018), themselves a subgroup of Pama-Nyungan (Hale 1964, 1966; see also Bowern \& Atkinson 2012). The language is no longer spoken, but it is traditionally associated with about 20 clans (as reconstructed by Rigsby 1999, 2014) belonging to the southern shores of Princess Charlotte Bay, on the east coast of Cape York Peninsula (see Figure 1). The clans’ estates are mainly coastal, extending from the Normanby River mouth in the east to about 10 km west of the North Kennedy River mouth, but they also include some inland estates (see Rigsby 1992: 356).},

The results show variation and change when compared to previous reports (both recent and of over a century ago). In spontaneous and elicited speech, ten distinct rhotic variants, subsequently recoded into five categories, were observed and quantified. Moreover, approximant and assibilated variants have notable frequencies and conditioning factors. VARBRUL analyses reveal phonological context, stress, word position, age, and sex as significant conditioning factors.},

After London, the north-west of England is the most densely populated of all regions in England and Wales, with the population of Liverpool standing at around 450,000. LE itself is said to have developed in the middle of the 19th century, after rapid immigration from Ireland during the Irish potato famines of 1845–1847 (see Knowles 1973). Arguably as a result of this immigration, as we will see, there are some similarities between LE's phonological system and those of Irish Englishes. Of course, as we might expect, the phonological system of LE maintains its connection with other northern Englishes, too.},

We present a new statistical universal linking speech with the evolutionarily ancient sense of touch. Words that express roughness—the primary perceptual dimension of texture—are highly likely to feature a trilled /r/, the most commonly occurring rhotic consonant. In four studies, we show the pattern to be extremely robust, being the first widespread pattern of iconicity documented not just across a large, diverse sample of the world’s spoken languages, but also across numerous sensory words within languages. Our deep analysis of Indo-European languages and Proto-Indo-European roots indicates remarkable historical stability of the pattern, which appears to date back at least 6000~years.},

The classification of Ladin within Western Romance has been the subject of a long-lasting scientific and at times ideological debate, particularly because at the end of the 19th century the region was contested between the new-born Italian state and the Habsburg empire. The varieties of Ladin share phonetic-phonological, morphological, syntactic and lexical features with the other languages spoken in the Central-Eastern Alps, such as Friulian and Romansh, thus leading to the identification of the Rhaeto-Romance group (Haiman \& Benincà 1992). However, in Ladin there are still many linguistic phenomena that connect it to the Romance dialects of Northern Italy. Therefore, a clear assignment of Ladin to a group is by no means a simple and uncontroversial operation (Salvi 2016).},

Data from twelve sociolinguistic interviews with men and women of different ages were analyzed acoustically with Praat and classified as the canonical trill or a different variant. Each token was then coded according to the following linguistic and extralinguistic factors: following vowel backness, position of /r/ in the word, grammatical category, number of syllables, syllable stress, corpus frequency, number of phonological neighbors, speaker age, and speaker sex. Results revealed that stressed syllables and the middle and older age groups favored the canonical trilled variant. Word-medial position and wordinitial position after a consonant also favored the trill, while word-initial after a vowel or a pause disfavored the trill. Corpus frequency was negatively correlated with canonical /r/ production, i.e. higher frequency disfavored trills, while number of phonological neighbors was positively correlated, i.e. words with more phonological neighbors favored the trill. These findings suggest that future research should define word position in more detail and also consider corpus frequency and phonological neighborhood as variables.},
