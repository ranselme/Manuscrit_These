  abstract = {Methods. Male subjects (n ¼ 23) diagnosed with mild obstructive sleep apnea and/or habitual snoring underwent acoustic analysis with the Multidimensional Voice Program (Kay Multi-Speech Model 3700 Advanced Version; Kay Elemetrics [KayPentax], Lincoln Park, NJ) before and 8 weeks after insertion of palatal implants to determine the effects of soft palate implants on voice and articulation. Sustained vowels (/a/e/u/o/i/) and phonetically balanced carrier sentences were used for acoustic analyses. Parameters measured were fundamental frequency (F0), jitter, shimmer, noise-to-harmonics ratio, Voice Turbulence Index, Soft Phonation Index, degree of voiceless, degree of voice breaks and peak amplitude variation, first formant (F1) and second formant (F2) frequencies, and voice onset time (VOT). F1 and F2 for each vowel were determined using linear predictive analysis on a spectrogram. VOT was measured for the palatal consonant /k/ and the dental consonant /t/ on a wideband spectrogram from a carrier sentence segment that contained a syllable with a stop consonant. Results. No statistically significant difference was detected in F0, F1, F2, or other MDVP parameters before and after implantation. Average VOT values measured for /t/ were not significantly different. On the other hand, average VOT values of /k/ were found to be significantly shorter. Conclusions. Implant insertion had no significant effect on MDVP parameters, F0, F1, or F2. On the other hand, articulation as a function of velar region seemed to be affected because VOT values of velar /k/ were changed.},

  abstract = {Cette thèse a pour objectif de définir l’apport de la phonétique expérimentale dans l’identification d’une variété lectale, en prenant pour exemple les langues parlées en Guadeloupe. En Guadeloupe, deux langues cohabitent : le français et le créole. Mais, dans les faits, il y a une diversité de variétés de français d’une part, et de créole d’autre part. Chacune de ces variétés va de l’acrolecte au basilecte en passant par le mésolecte : il y a donc un continuum français et un continuum créole. La situation sociolinguistique de la Guadeloupe peut être ainsi représentée par un double continuum.Ces différentes variétés de français peuvent-elles se distinguer par des caractéristiques (1) acoustiques, (2) phonétiques, (3) phonologiques et (4) perceptives de la consonne /R/? La durée du contact avec le créole, a t-elle une influence sur la variété de français parlée par un locuteur ?Nos résultats montrent que plus la variété de français est basilectale, (1) plus la diffusion de l’énergie spectrale du /R/ est faible avec un taux de bruit réduit et une hauteur moyenne des fréquences basse ; (2) plus la variante fricatisée du /R/ est rare et plus la variante approximante est fréquente ; (3) plus le taux d’élision du /R/ en coda de syllabe augmente ainsi que le taux de réalisation de /R/ en tant que [w] en contexte labial; (4) plus la variété est perçue comme ayant un faible degré d’accent français. Généralement, plus la durée du contact entre le français et le créole est longue, plus cette variété est basilectale.Si les caractéristiques de la consonne /R/ permettent de discriminer la variété acrolectale de la variété basilectale (variétés extrêmes), il apparait plus difficile d’établir une liste d’indices (ou « lectomètres ») qui permettraient d’identifier les variétés se trouvant dans la zone intermédiaire : le mésolecte est doté d’une certaine imprévisibilité.},

  abstract = {The current study investigated whether phonetic complexity affected stuttering rate in Jordanian Arabic speakers. Speakers were assigned to three age groups (6–11, 12–17 and 18þ years). An Arabic index of phonetic complexity (AIPC) was developed. Each word was given a score based on the number of complex phonetic properties out of a total of nine that it contained in the AIPC. The results showed that stuttering on function words for Jordanian Arabic did not correlate significantly with the AIPC score for any age group. The AIPC scores of content and function-content words correlated positively with stuttering rate for the 6–11 age group alone with the function-content words affecting fluency more severely than did the content words. The AIPC scores of stuttered function, content and stuttered function-content words were higher than those of fluent words. The non-stuttered words had lower AIPC scores than the stuttered corresponding classes. This showed that the higher the AIPC score on stuttered words, the greater the chance for these word categories to be stuttered. The AIPC factors that most affected fluency in Jordanian Arabic were place of articulation, manner of articulation, word length, word shape and consonant length. We conclude that Arabic is similar to other languages with regard to the loci of stuttering, their phonetic complexity and AIPC factors affecting stuttering most. The correlation between phonetic complexity and the order of the AIPC factors are different between Arabic and other languages.},

  abstract = {Are morphological patterns learned in the form of rules? Some models deny this, attributing all morphology to analogical mechanisms. The dual mechanism model (Pinker, S., \& Prince, A. (1998). On language and connectionism: analysis of a parallel distributed processing model of language acquisition. Cognition, 28, 73 – 193) posits that speakers do internalize rules, but that these rules are few and cover only regular processes; the remaining patterns are attributed to analogy. This article advocates a third approach, which uses multiple stochastic rules and no analogy. We propose a model that employs inductive learning to discover multiple rules, and assigns them confidence scores based on their performance in the lexicon. Our model is supported over the two alternatives by new “wug test” data on English past tenses, which show that participant ratings of novel pasts depend on the phonological shape of the stem, both for irregulars and, surprisingly, also for regulars. The latter observation cannot be explained under the dual mechanism approach, which derives all regulars with a single rule. To evaluate the alternative hypothesis that all morphology is analogical, we implemented a purely analogical model, which evaluates novel pasts based solely on their similarity to existing verbs. Tested against experimental data, this analogical model also failed in key respects: it could not locate patterns that require abstract structural characterizations, and it favored implausible responses based on single, highly similar exemplars. We conclude that speakers extend morphological patterns based on abstract structural properties, of a kind appropriately described with rules.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the relationship of the vocal tract dimensions and dental arches in participants with substitution of palatal approximant /j/ for the trill variant of /r/. Method: Cephalograms and dental casts of 60 native speakers of Arabic were used for comparison. The experimental group included 30 participants with substitution of /j/ for the trill variant of /r/ (17 males and 13 females, age ranged between 15–20 years, M ϭ 18.7 years, SD ϭ 1.27). The control group included 30 normal speakers (15 males and 15 females, age ranged between 15–20 years, M ϭ 18.3 years, SD ϭ 1.67). Both groups had class I occlusion. Result:The experimental group showed significantly shorter maxillary length, p Ͻ 0.05, and narrower vocal tract dimensions compared to the control group, p Ͻ 0.05.Tongue length (TGL) and height (TGH) and soft palate length (PNSP) and thickness (MPT) were statistically significantly reduced in the experimental group compared to the control group, p Ͻ 0.05. The distance between the hyoid bone and retrognathion or C3 was significantly shorter in the experimental group compared to the control group, p Ͻ 0.05. Inter-canine widths and dental arch lengths were significantly shorter in the experimental group compared to the control group, p Ͻ 0.05. Conclusion: The substitution of /j/ for the trill variant of /r/ is associated with altered dimensions of the vocal tract. These alterations may explain the residual articulation disorder during the production of the trilled /r/ compared to other sound classes that respond to speech therapy. Orthodontic and Maxillo facial surgery consultation might be needed when providing therapy to individuals with this particular articulation disorder.},

Di culties with emphatic consonants, consonant sequences and /r/ were felt to be due to articulatory di culty, whereas the early accuracy of back fricatives and /l/ may be due to their high frequency in the language and relatively high functional load.},

Vocal fatigue was measured subjectively using Vocal Fatigue Index and Borg vocal effort scale and objectively using variations of relative sound pressure level, fundamental frequency, pitch strength, smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPS), and acoustic voice quality index before, during, and after VLT. Participants provided information on their sleep quantity, stress, and depression through nonstandardized and standardized surveys. Results. Results revealed that perceived effort and fatigue increased significantly after the 30-minute VLT. Acoustic measures of relative sound pressure level and fundamental frequency and increased systematically during and after the completion of task. All students were moderately stressed and measures related to pitch were highly related with perceived stress. Conclusions. The results of this study provide support for altering multiple vocal parameters to induce measurable changes in vocal fatigue following a short-duration VLT.},

  abstract = {Contrary to what non-practitioners might expect, the systems of phonetic notation used by linguists are highly idiosyncratic. Not only do various linguistic subfields disagree on the specific symbols they use to denote the speech sounds of languages, but also in large databases of sound inventories considerable variation can be found. Inspired by recent efforts to link cross-linguistic data with help of reference catalogues (Glottolog, Concepticon) across different resources, we present initial efforts to link different phonetic notation systems to a catalogue of speech sounds. This is achieved with the help of a database accompanied by a software framework that uses a limited but easily extendable set of non-binary feature values to allow for quick and convenient registration of different transcription systems, while at the same time linking to additional datasets with restricted inventories. Linking different transcription systems enables us to conveniently translate between different phonetic transcription systems, while linking sounds to databases allows users quick access to various kinds of metadata, including feature values, statistics on phoneme inventories, and information on prosody and sound classes. In order to prove the feasibility of this enterprise, we supplement an initial version of our crosslinguistic database of phonetic transcription systems (CLTS), which currently registers five transcription systems and links to fifteen datasets, as well as a web application, which permits users to conveniently test the power of the automatic translation across transcription systems.},

  abstract = {Many studies have pointed out that the /r/ sounds in Japanese tend to be difficult for native children of Japanese to acquire. To verify this, we first investigated Japanese /r/ sounds uttered by two-year-old twins as a case study. The acoustic analysis of the recordings, which included several words with various /r/ sounds, revealed that certain /r/ sounds are difficult to produce and are often produced with speech errors. We also analyzed a set of utterances of Japanese /r/ spoken in a variety of phones pronounced by an adult male speaker. Then, for comparison, we synthesized Japanese /r/ sounds using four parameters. We conducted two perceptual experiments: one for the natural speech by the male speaker of Japanese, and another for the synthesized speech sounds based on the four parameters. The results showed that variation in pronunciation in adults was widely distributed. We discussed the reasons that it takes time for children to acquire /r/ sounds, and we concluded that it is possibly due to the combination of two factors: 1) some /r/ sounds themselves are difficult to produce, and 2) there is a wide distribution of pronunciation variation in adult speakers.},

  abstract = {The variety described here is Pontic Greek (ISO 639 name: pnt), and specifically the variety that originates from Trapezounta in Asia Minor (present-day Trabzon in Turkey) as spoken today in Etoloakarnania, Greece by second-generation refugees. The term ‘Pontic Greek’ (in Greek: ) was originally an etic term, while Pontians called their language by other names, mainly [ɾoˈmeika]  ‘Romeika’ (Sitaridou 2016) but also [laziˈka]  ‘Laz language’ (Drettas 1997: 19, 620), even though Pontians and Laz people do not share the same language, the latter being Caucasian. Nowadays, is the standard term used not only by researchers, but also by native speakers of Pontic Greek born in Greece to refer to their variety (but see Sitaridou 2013 for Romeyka in the Black Sea). Pontic Greek belongs to the Asia Minor Greek group along with other varieties, such as Cappadocian Greek (e.g. Horrocks 2010: 398–404; Sitaridou 2014: 31). According to Sitaridou (2014, 2016), on the basis of historical reconstruction, the Pontic branch of Asia Minor Greek is claimed to have been divided into two major dialectal groups: Pontic Greek as spoken by Christians until the 20th century in Turkey and Romeyka as spoken by Muslims to date in Turkey. Triantafyllidis (1938/1981: 288) divides Pontic varieties, as were spoken in Asia Minor, into three dialectal groups, namely Oinountian, Chaldiot, and Trapezountian, the latter consisting of the varieties that were spoken at Trapezounta, Kerasounta, Rizounta, Sourmena, Ofis, Livera, Tripolis, and Matsouka in Asia Minor (Trabzon, Giresun, Sürmene, Of, Yazlık, Tirebolu, and Maçka respectively in present-day Turkey). However, Triantafyllidis does not explain his criteria for this classification (Chatzissavidis 2012). According to one other classification (Papadopoulos 1955: 17–18; Papadopoulos 1958:  ), the variety that was used in Trapezounta belongs to the dialectal group in which post-stressed /i/ and /u/ delete along other varieties, such as e.g. the ones that were spoken in Chaldia (present-day Gümüşhane), Sourmena, and Ofis (as opposed to the rest of Pontic varieties, such as the one of Kerasounta, in which those vowels are retained). Trapezountian Pontic Greek can also be classified with the group of varieties that retain word-final /n/, such as the varieties of Kerasounta and Chaldia, as opposed to the varieties that do not retain it, such as the ones of Oinoe (present-day Ünye) and (partially) Ofis (Papadopoulos 1958: θ).},

Other languages spoken in Raja Ampat include Maˈya, Matbat, Biga, Batta, and several closely-related varieties on Salawati island (all RASH); Biak (a non-RASH SHWNG language); and varieties of Malay, in particular Papuan Malay. While historically Maˈya and Biak were used as lingua francas throughout the archipelago, these days Malay is the dominant language. The spread of Malay in recent decades has been facilitated by improvements in telecommunications and infrastructure in the region; the government-backed immigration of Indonesians from the overcrowded western islands of the nation to the more sparsely populated Papua; and a rapidly growing tourist industry throughout Raja Ampat.},

Due to lengthy isolation, Cypriot Greek is so distinct from Standard Greek as to be often unintelligible to speakers of the Standard. Greek Cypriot speakers, on the other hand, have considerably less difficulty understanding Greeks, since Standard Greek is the official language of Cyprus, and as such it is the medium of education and the language of the Cypriot media. However, in every day situations Cypriot Greek is the only variety used among Cypriots. Cypriot Greek is not homogeneous but exhibits considerable geographical variation (Newton 1972). The variety described here is that used by educated speakers, particularly the inhabitants of the capital, Nicosia. Although influenced by increasing contact with Standard Greek, Cypriot Greek retains most of its phonological and phonetic characteristics virtually intact. There is no established orthography for Cypriot Greek; however, certain, rather variable, conventions have emerged, based on Greek historical orthography but also including novel combinations of letters in order to represent sounds that do not exist in the Standard (e.g. σι for [∫]); a version of these conventions has been adopted here for the sample text. The transcription is based on the speech of an educated male speaker from Nicosia in his mid-thirties, who read the text twice at normal speed and in an informal manner, he also assisted in rendering the text from Standard to Cypriot Greek.},

  abstract = {Modem Greek is a descendant of Classical Greek and is spoken today by approximately 11,000,000 people living in Greece. In addition, it is spoken (with various modifications) in large Greek immigrant communities in North America, Australia and elsewhere. Although the Modern Greek dialects had largely been shaped by the 10th c. A.D. (Browning 1983), the linguistic situation in Greece has been one of               diglossia               from the middle 19th c. (the early beginnings of the independent Greek state) and until 1976. The High and Low varieties of Greek diglossia are known as               Katharevousa               and               Dhimotiki               respectively. Katharevousa was a purist, partly invented, variety that was heavily influenced by Classical Greek; the term Dhimotiki, on the other hand, loosely describes the mother tongue of the Greeks, which was confined to oral communication. In 1976 the use of Katharevousa was officially abolished and gradually a new standard based on Dhimotiki as spoken in Athens has emerged. This variety is adopted by an increasingly large number of educated speakers all over Greece, who choose it over regional varieties (Mackridge 1985). In spelling, Modern Greek has kept many of the conventions of Ancient Greek, although several simplifications have taken place since 1976. Perhaps the most dramatic of these has been the decision to stop using accent and breath marks (which have not had phonetic correspondents in the language for nearly 2,000 years); these marks were replaced by one accent on the stressed vowel of each word with two or more syllables. The variety described here is Standard Modern Greek as spoken by Athenians. The sample text in particular is based on recordings of two Athenian speakers, a male in his mid-twenties and a female in her mid-thirties. Both speakers read the passage twice in relatively informal style.},

  abstract = {Typical and atypical /r/ : a research on different /r/ productions produced by Finnish-speaking children from the perspective of acoustic features and ultrasound imaging Existing research has yet to explore the production of Finnish children's /r/ sounds and their phonetic variants, despite /r/ sound errors being among the most common speech sound disorders in children. In addition, existing research mainly relies on perceptual observation, which presents challenges when it comes to accurately identifying the quality of the sound error. The use of more objective methods of analysis is essential for the comparability of the research data. The aim of this study was to determine how acoustic analysis and ultrasound analysis can provide new insights and information about the typical and atypical /r/ productions produced by children. This study was conducted as part of the Enhancing visual feedback with ultrasound project, and the results will be used to design an acoustic analysis protocol to measure the effectiveness of controlled ultrasound intervention. The subjects in this study were four boys aged 10–11 years, all of whom produced the Finnish /r/ sound atypically, as well as two control subjects who had already acquired the typical Finnish /r/ sound. The subjects’ different /r/ productions were examined in the study by acoustic analysis and ultrasound analysis. In the Praat program, it was possible to visually observe the manner of articulation, the number of closing and opening phases (vibrations) characteristic of trills, the qualitative variation in the closing phases and the frequency structure of the /r/ sound from the spectrogram and oscillogram. In addition, it was possible to determine the duration of the /r/ sound and, in some cases, formant values. These results reveal variation in the production of the Finnish /r/ even among the control subjects. The word/sound position of the speech sound and the length of the sound appeared to have an effect on the realization and duration of the trill, and more vibrations occurred in longer-lasting trills. When the /r/ sound was produced as an apico-alveolar trill, the main acoustic characteristics of the speech sound were the alternating closing and opening phases (vibrations) and the lower F3 relative to the surrounding vowel environment, as already noted in a previous study. Due to the wide range of phonetic variants that might replace the /r/ sound the differences between typical and atypical /r/ productions were observed depending on the speaker in the manner of articulation, sound duration and/or the number of closing phases. In this study, it was not possible to determine the place of articulation by acoustic analysis, which is partly explained by the failure of formant analysis due to the poor quality of the test subjects' data. Thus, ultrasound data was also included in the analysis, from which it was possible to visually confirm the atypical place of articulation. These results therefore demonstrate how acoustic analysis and ultrasound analysis can supplement auditory perception and provide more qualitative and quantitative information on /r/ productions produced by children. However, it is important for the researcher to consider the typical variation in the realization of /r/ productions and the certain limitations associated with the use of both methods of analysis already at the data collection stage of the study, such as the selection of test words and number of repetitions.},

  abstract = {Languages spoken in larger populations are relatively simple. A possible explanation for this is that languages with a greater number of speakers tend to also be those with higher proportions of non-native speakers, who may simplify language during learning. We assess this explanation for the negative correlation between population size and linguistic complexity in three experiments, using artificial language learning techniques to investigate both the simplifications made by individual adult learners and the potential for such simplifications to influence group-level language characteristics. In Experiment 1, we show that individual adult learners trained on a morphologically complex miniature language simplify its morphology. In Experiment 2, we explore how these simplifications may then propagate through subsequent learning. We use the languages produced by the participants of Experiment 1 as the input for a second set of learners, manipulating (a) the proportion of their input which is simplified and (b) the number of speakers they receive their input from. We find, contrary to expectations, that mixing the input from multiple speakers nullifies the simplifications introduced by individuals in Experiment 1; simplifications at the individual level do not result in simplification of the population’s language. In Experiment 3, we focus on language use as a mechanism for simplification, exploring the consequences of the interaction between individuals differing in their linguistic competence (as native and non-native speakers might). We find that speakers who acquire a more complex language than their partner simplify their language during interaction. We ultimately conclude that adult learning can result in languages spoken by more people having simpler morphology, but that idiosyncratic simplifications by non-natives do not offer a complete explanation in themselves; accommodation—by comparatively competent non-natives to less competent speakers, or by native speakers to non-natives—may be a key linking mechanism.},

  abstract = {Languages differ in their complexity. One possible explanation for this observation is that differences in social factors influence linguistic complexity: languages that are used for communication in smallscale ‘societies of intimates’ exhibit greater complexity as a result of the communicative contexts in which they are typically employed. We used the techniques from referential communication studies across three experiments to assess the effects of two social group factors—group size and amount of communally shared knowledge—on the brevity and transparency of linguistic conventions. In Experiment 1, we explored the effects of a manipulation of group size, comparing the conventions which develop from the interaction of two speakers, with those which develop between three speakers. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the extent to which groups of three speakers share talk-relevant contextual information. While we found the conditions that involve larger groups and less shared background information initially resulted in longer labels and a greater reliance on more literal descriptive terms, there was no effect of either factor in the longer term. In Experiment 3, we investigated the transparency of the conventions of Experiments 1 and 2 by assessing how well they could be matched to their intended referents by naive individuals. We found no evidence to support the claims that communicative contexts involving communicating with more individuals, or individuals with whom less relevant information is shared, produce more transparent conventions. Our experiments ultimately provide no support for the idea that the structure of linguistic conventions is shaped by the groups in which they develop.},

We employ two very different stochastic models of lexical evolution – Gray \& Atkinson’s (2003) finite-sites model and a stochastic-Dollo model of word evolution introduced by Nicholls \& Gray (in press). Results of this analysis support the findings of Gray \& Atkinson (2003). We also tested the ability of both methods to reconstruct phylogeny and divergence times accurately from synthetic data. The methods performed well under a range of scenarios, including widespread and localized borrowing.},

  abstract = {Khuzestani Arabic (ISO 639-3) is a minority language spoken in the southern west of Iran, in Khuzestan province (see Figure 1). The majority of its speakers live in Ahwaz, Howeyzeh, Bostan, Susangerd, Shush, Abadan, Khorramshahr, Shadegan, Hamidiyeh (Balawi \&amp; Khezri 2014: 107), Karun, and Bawi. According to Blanc (1964: 6), this variety of Arabic is closely related to the Gelet subgroup of Mesopotamian dialects.               1               This dialect is in contact with Bakhtiyari Lori and Persian (Iranian languages of the Indo-Iranian branch of Indo-European language family), as well as Iraqi Arabic. The lexis of the dialect predominantly contains Arabic words, but it also has several Persian, English, French, and Turkish loanwords.},

  abstract = {The transcription of speech into a graphic code is a basic procedure in both dialectology and sociolinguistics, and typically, it is this graphic analog of speech that forms the data for analysis in both disciplines. The act of transcription, however, affects linguistic data in subtle,difficult-to-detect ways. This paper demonstrates some of those effects by examining impressionistic phonetic data in American linguistic atlases. The paper identifies three sources of transcriber effects in the data: (1)conceptual differences regarding the phonetic status of particular sounds(e.g., offglides of diphthongs) and how they should be transcribed, (2)normative differences regarding the phonetic values of particular symbols, and(3) changing scribal practices as transcribers discover the importance of phonetic details that they had previously overlooked. When transcriber effects such as these are not identified and accounted for in the analysis of the data, they can create misleading results.},

  abstract = {Language documentation faces a persistent and pervasive problem: How much material is enough to represent a language fully? How much text would we need to sample the full phoneme inventory of a language? In the phonetic/phonemic domain, what proportion of the phoneme inventory can we expect to sample in a text of a given length? Answering these questions in a quantifiable way is tricky, but asking them is necessary. The cumulative collection of Illustrative Texts published in the Illustration series in this journal over more than four decades (mostly renditions of the ‘North Wind and the Sun’) gives us an ideal dataset for pursuing these questions. Here we investigate a tractable subset of the above questions, namely: What proportion of a language’s phoneme inventory do these texts enable us to recover, in the minimal sense of having at least one allophone of each phoneme? We find that, even with this low bar, only three languages (Modern Greek, Shipibo and the Treger dialect of Breton) attest all phonemes in these texts. Unsurprisingly, these languages sit at the low end of phoneme inventory sizes (respectively 23, 24 and 36 phonemes). We then estimate the rate at which phonemes are sampled in the Illustrative Texts and extrapolate to see how much text it might take to display a language’s full inventory. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for linguistics in its quest to represent the world’s phonetic diversity, and for JIPA in its design requirements for Illustrations and in particular whether supplementary panphonic texts should be included.},

Other, written sources include (Baird 2001) and (Baird 2002). Kéo has been said to belong to the Ende-Lio languages of the Bima-Sumba subgroup of the Central Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian family (B. Grimes 1988, C. Grimes et al. 1997). The Central/Eastern Malayo-Polynesian grouping has been proposed by Blust, but this is not strongly supported by the comparative method. Likewise, there is very little evidence to support the notion of a Bima-Sumba subgroup at this stage. Much more linguistic work needs to be undertaken in the region before precise genetic relationships can be established.},

Information was gathered from literature searches and forums of First Nations and non-First Nations speech-language pathologists, developmentalists, and linguists. The exploratory findings suggest that First Nations English dialects are shaped both by transference of features from the ancestral languages and by cultural patterns of communication. The dialects likely represent late stages of depidginization and decreolization. Examples of phonological and syntactic dialectal features illustrate the importance of recognizing non-standard varieties of English when assessing speakers of First Nations communities and setting up goals and strategies for treatment. Research is urgently needed to identify features of First Nations English dialects both for linguistic documentation and to help speech-language pathologists and other educators to distinguish between language impairments and dialect differences and to develop culturally relevant assessment and intervention practices.},

It then considers how potential users of reference grammars can be identified in minority language contexts and how grammars can be structured in order to meet the needs of users who are native speakers of the language without being language specialists. The study next addresses the problem of content, considering both what to include and how to include it. In this section particular attention is paid to making metalinguistic and terminological choices, establishing grammatical norms and handling regional variations, deciding on the depth and breadth of grammatical description to include, selecting grammatical points to include, organizing the selected content optimally, choosing and integrating illustrative examples, and including key non linguistic information. Next follows a discussion of the various solutions arrived at in the case of writing a reference grammar for the Innu language. Among these figure the use of a multilevel approach designed to address the needs of a varied reading public, the selection of teachers as the target audience, the organization of content according to a hybrid structural-function approach, and the decision to write the grammar in a majority language. Although the challenges posed by the creation of minority language reference grammars vary substantially from one context to the next, it is hoped that many of the basic grammaticographie principles developed within the framework of this study will prove useful to others engaged in reference grammar writing in the case of endangered and poorly documented languages.},

Immediately following training on /f -/ in non-words, the child generalized across consonant+liquid clusters and the tap singleton. These improvements continued to 2 months post-treatment follow-up, with the ultimate addition of the trill at that point in time. Consonant+glide sequences, whose structural status as complex onsets is debated in the Spanish phonology literature, patterned differently from consonant+liquid sequences.

  abstract = {This article presents a typological overview of palatalization, addressing issues such as the definition of palatalization, palatalization types, the sounds that undergo palatalization (targets), and the sounds that trigger palatalization (triggers). In exploring these issues we review five typological studies of palatalization that present a series of implicational relationships among palatalization targets and triggers. For example, if labials palatalize, so do coronals and dorsals, and if low front vowels trigger palatalization, so do high front vowels. The generalizations in these studies further make predictions about possible palatalization grammars we should expect to find, or to not find, in the world’s languages.},

There are a further one million or more speakers in Botswana, where it is the dominant national language, and a smaller number of speakers in Namibia. The recordings accompanying this article were mostly produced with a 21-year-old male speaker from the area of Taung, North-West province, South Africa. Some of the accompanying recordings are of a 23-year-old female speaker from Kuruman (approximately 150 km west of Taung). The observations reported here are based on consulting with both these speakers, as well as a third speaker, from Kimberley. All three were speakers of South African Setswana varieties. For discussion of some differences between these varieties and more Northern and Eastern Setswana dialects – including those spoken in Botswana – see (Doke 1954, Cole 1955, University of Botswana 2001).},

The need to compare languages with regard to their complexity resulted in a multitude of approaches and methods, ranging from accounts targeting specific structural features to global quantification of variation more generally. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which morphological complexity measures are mutually correlated in a sample of more than 500 languages of 101 language families. We use human expert judgements from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS), and compare them to four quantitative measures automatically calculated from language corpora. These consist of three previously defined corpus-derived measures, which are all monolingual, and one new measure based on automatic word-alignment across pairs of languages. We find strong correlations between all the measures, illustrating that both expert judgements and automated approaches converge to similar complexity ratings, and can be used interchangeably.},

Data were from preschool children with typical versus protracted phonological development (PPD) in Iceland, Sweden (Germanic), Portugal, Spain/Chile (Romance), Bulgaria, Slovenia (Slavic), and Hungary (Finno-Ugric). Results showed developmental group and age effects. Clusters generally had lower accuracy than singletons, although not uniformly, and were more accurate in stressed syllables. The rhotics were less advanced than alveolar /l/ except in European Portuguese, where the lateral is velarized. In early development, the rhotic is often deleted, but in later, development substitutions for rhotics were more common, primarily non-nasal coronal sonorants, which match some of the place and manner features of the rhotic. Vowel epenthesis sometimes appeared in rhotic clusters. Children with PPD showed more varied mismatch patterns, including more than one mismatch pattern within a cluster. Implications for research and clinical practice are suggested.},

  abstract = {All surgical procedures for treatment of snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea modify the anatomical structure of the upper airways and the resonance characteristics of the vocal tract; this can lead to a modification in voice quality. Purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible modifications of the fundamental frequency (F0) and of the frequency and amplitude of the first (F1) and second (F2) formants of the 5 Italian vowels after different surgical procedures for snoring, to verify if and how these operations can influence voice quality. A total of 40 snoring or obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome patients, not affected by laryngeal, pulmonary or neurologic disorders likely to alter voice production, were selected for the study. All were submitted to acoustic voice analysis prior to surgery and again 1 month after discharge. F0 was unchanged. The frequency of F1 of the vowel /a/ audio of F2 of the vowel /e/ were significantly higher, while F1 of /i/ and F2 of /o/ and /u/ were significantly lower compared to pre-operative values. The modifications in the anatomical structure and volume of the vocal tract, induced by the surgical procedures used for the treatment of snoring, can modify the values of the formants and, as a consequence, quality of the voice. This change can be detected not only by means of the acoustic analysis but also by the patient itself. For this reason, singers and all professional voice users about to undergo surgical treatment for snoring should be informed of this potential modification of the voice not only for clinical reasons but also for legal purposes.},

A major consequence of this influence is that the phonemic system of Telugu has been extended by additional sets of sounds. Thus, the aspirates /               p               ʰ               b               ʱ               t               ʰ               d               ʱ ʈʰ ɖʱ ʧʰ ʤʱ               k               ʰ ɡʱ/ and fricatives /ʃ ʂ               h               /, absent in the native phonemic system, entered the language through Sanskrit borrowings. Similarly, /               f               / entered the language through Perso-Arabic and English borrowings. Some of the sounds from Perso-Arabic and English sources were nativized, for example, Perso-Arabic and English phoneme /ʃ/ was rendered as /ʂ/, which had already entered the language through borrowings from Sanskrit/Prakrit; Perso-Arabic phonemes /               q               x               ɣ               z               / were rendered as /               k               k               ʰ ɡ ʤ/ respectively; and the English phoneme /θ/ was rendered as /               t               ʰ/. English borrowings also resulted in re-phonemicization. In native Telugu vocabulary, [ɛ] and [ӕː] are allophones of /               e               / and /               e               ː/ respectively, but they acquire phonemic status when words borrowed from English are included in the total vocabulary of the language.},

  abstract = {Nafsan (ISO 639-3: erk, Glottocode: sout2856), also known as South Efate, is a Southern Oceanic language of Vanuatu. It is spoken in Erakor, Eratap and Pango, three villages situated along the southern coast of the island of Efate (Figure~1) (Clark 1985, Lynch 2000, Thieberger 2006). Nafsan is also closely related to Eton, Lelepa, Nakanamanga and Namakura, spoken further to the north on Efate and some smaller neighbouring islands.1 Nafsan is often described as the southernmost member of the North-Central Vanuatu group of languages, and the Nafsan and Eton-speaking communities are noted to be at the core of ‘an unmistakable area of innovation’ compared to their northern neighbours (Clark 1985: 25). Though crosslinguistic comparisons suggest a clear boundary between North-Central Vanuatu languages and languages of the Southern Vanuatu group, there is evidence that Nafsan speakers have both linguistic and cultural links to the southern islands, suggestive of complex historical relationships between the populations of the central and southern regions (Lynch 2004; Thieberger 2007, 2015). In terms of the sound system, Nafsan is noted to be of particular interest because it ‘forms a transition between the phonologically more conservative languages to the north and the more “aberrant” languages to the south’ (Lynch 2000: 320), and exhibits phonotactic patterns which are complex and typologically uncommon, particularly among Oceanic languages (Thieberger 2006).},

Within the Belarusian language, the two main dialects are North Eastern and South Western (Avanesaǔ et al. 1963, Lapkoǔskaya 2008, Smolskaya 2011). Two additional regional forms of Belarusian can be distinguished: the Middle Belarusian dialectal group, incorporating some features of North Eastern and South Western dialects together with certain characteristics of its own, and the West-Polesian (or Brest-Pinsk) dialectal group. The latter group is more distinct linguistically from the other Belarusian dialects and is in many respects close to the Ukrainian language (Lapkoǔskaya 2008, Smolskaya 2011). The focus of this illustration is Standard Belarusian, which is based on Middle Belarusian speech varieties. For details on the phonetic differences across dialects, the reader is referred to Avanesaǔ et al. (1963) and Lapkoǔskaya (2008).},

  abstract = {The transcription bottleneck is often cited as a major obstacle for efforts to document the world’s endangered languages and supply them with language technologies. One solution is to extend methods from automatic speech recognition and machine translation, and recruit linguists to provide narrow phonetic transcriptions and sentence-aligned translations. However, I believe that these approaches are not a good fit with the available data and skills, or with long-established practices that are essentially word-based. In seeking a more effective approach, I consider a century of transcription practice and a wide range of computational approaches, before proposing a computational model based on spoken term detection that I call “sparse transcription.” This represents a shift away from current assumptions that we transcribe phones, transcribe fully, and transcribe first. Instead, sparse transcription combines the older practice of word-level transcription with interpretive, iterative, and interactive processes that are amenable to wider participation and that open the way to new methods for processing oral languages.},

We show converging evidence from paleoanthropology, speech biomechanics, ethnography, and historical linguistics that labiodental sounds (such as “f” and “v”) were innovated after the Neolithic. Changes in diet attributable to food-processing technologies modified the human bite from an edge-to-edge configuration to one that preserves adolescent overbite and overjet into adulthood. This change favored the emergence and maintenance of labiodentals. Our findings suggest that language is shaped not only by the contingencies of its history, but also by culturally induced changes in human biology.},

  abstract = {Languages emerge and change over time at the population level though interactions between individual speakers. It is, however, hard to directly observe how a single speaker’s linguistic innovation precipitates a population-wide change in the language, and many theoretical proposals exist. We introduce a very general mathematical model that encompasses a wide variety of individual-level linguistic behaviours and provides statistical predictions for the population-level changes that result from them. This model allows us to compare the likelihood of empirically-attested changes in definite and indefinite articles in multiple languages under different assumptions on the way in which individuals learn and use language. We find that accounts of language change that appeal primarily to errors in childhood language acquisition are very weakly supported by the historical data, whereas those that allow speakers to change incrementally across the lifespan are more plausible, particularly when combined with social network effects.},

  abstract = {Vowel prothesis is a phonological process by which a vowel is inserted at the beginning of a word. Vowel prothesis before a rhotic is attested in a number of languages of the world and has been discussed by Hall (2011), where the instantiation of this phenomenon in the Walliser dialect of Swiss German received a theoretical treatment couched in the framework of Optimality Theory (OT). In this paper, I revisit that process of vowel prothesis and discuss vowel prothesis before /r/ in light of the phonetics of such a development as well as the typology of such a change. It will be argued that vowel prothesis before a rhotic only comes about when that rhotic is a trill. This is because trilled rhotics in the world’s languages are known to involve a brief vocalic period (roughly 50 ms) prior to the onset of vibration. Furthermore, all languages with an attested change of \#rV- → \#VrV- e.g. Walliser German, Campidanian Sardinian, Basque, Gascon and Sakha (Yakut) have an alveolar trilled /r/. In terms of OT, I analyze this as due to a high-ranking constraint against trills in the prosodic-word initial position, formulated as *ω[Trill.},

The notion of a lexeme is usually associated with the work of P. H. Matthews (1972, 1974), who characterizes it as a lexical entity abstracting over individual inflected words. Over the last three decades, the lexeme has become a cornerstone of much work in both inflectional morphology and word formation (or, as it is increasingly been called, lexeme formation). The papers in the present volume take stock of the descriptive and theoretical usefulness of the lexeme, but also adress many of the challenges met by classical lexeme-based theories of morphology.},

We first define a notion of paradigmatic system that extends conservatively the notion as it is used in inflection so as to be applicable to collections of structured families of derivationally-related words. We then build on this definition in an empirical quantitative study of derivational families of verbs in French. We apply information-theoretic measures of predictability initially designed by Ackerman et al. (2009) in the context of inflection. We conclude that key quantitative properties are common to inflectional and derivational paradigmatic systems, and hence that (partial) paradigms are an important ingredient of the study of derivation.},

The two groups were highly similar in the phonological processes reflected in their speech, although several of the phonologically disordered children applied common phonological processes in unusual ways. Children in both subject groups produced errors (e.g., /I/ for /r/, /n/ for /l/) that reflected a sensitivity to the phonetic characteristics of the phonemes of Italian as well as to the types of sounds in the language that might serve as reasonable substitutes. These findings suggest that phonologically disordered children’s errors represent more than failed attempts at articulatory targets, as the productions that result remain faithful to the structure of the ambient phonology.},

However, the emerging variety of Portuguese spoken in São Tomé and Príncipe diverges from the standard norm and shows great variability in its use of rhotics; specifically, Santomeans often use a strong-R in positions that require a weak-r in European and Brazilian Portuguese. Sociolinguistic interviews with 56 speakers from the capital of São Tomé and Príncipe and its surroundings provide 5287 data points for analysis. Based on the apparent-time construct (Bailey, 2004; Bailey et al., 1991), variation patterns show a language change in progress in the use of the strong-R, with younger speakers using it more frequently. Results also reveal the emergence of rhotic fricatives in the speech of Santomeans born after the independence of the country.},

This increasing awareness is analysed in terms of orders of indexicality. The author suggests that awareness of this rhotic feature among Santomeans is contingent on having contact with Portuguese speakers of non-Santomean origin, as they only become aware of their distinctive use of rhotics when they are in contact with speakers of another variety of Portuguese on the island, in the diaspora, or online. Also, even if this feature is perceived negatively by many, it remains available for identity-driven use to express a connection to São Tomé and Príncipe.},

Currently about five people speak the language fluently, but approximately 1,000 people identify as Bardi. The region was settled by Europeans in the 1880s and two missions were founded in Bardi country in the 1890s. Use of the language began declining in the 1930s. Many Bardi people were moved several times between 1940 and 1970, both to other missions dominated by speakers of other Indigenous languages and to local towns such as Derby. This community disruption accelerated the decline of language use in the community and first language acquisition. Bardi is the name of the language variety spoken at One Arm Point. There are two other named mutually intelligible varieties apart from Bardi: Baard and Jawi. The extent of dialect diversity within Bardi is unknown, but does not seem to have been particularly high compared to that between named varieties.

  abstract = {In two adaptation experiments we investigated the role of phonemes in speech perception. Participants repeatedly categorized an ambiguous test word that started with a blended /f/-/s/ fricative (?ail can be perceived as /fail/ or /sail/) or a blended /d/-/b/ stop (?ump can be perceived as /bump/ or /dump/) after exposure to a set of adaptor words. The adaptors all included unambiguous /f/ or /s/ fricatives, or alternatively, /d/ or /b/ stops. In Experiment 1 we manipulated the position of the adaptor phonemes so that they occurred at the start of the word (e.g., farm), at the start of the second syllable (e.g., tofu), or the end of the word (e.g., leaf). We found that adaptation effects occurred across positions: Participants were less likely to categorize the ambiguous test stimulus as if it contained the adapted phoneme. For example, after exposure to the adaptors leaf, golf... etc., participants were more likely to categorize the ambiguous test word ?ail as ‘sail’. In Experiment 2 we also varied the voice of the speaker: Words with unambiguous final phoneme adaptors were spoken by a female while the ambiguous initial test phonemes were spoken by a male. Again robust adaptation effects occurred. Critically, in both experiments, similar adaptation effects were obtained for the fricatives and stops despite the fact that the acoustics of stops vary more as a function of position. We take these findings to support the claim that position independent phonemes play a role in spoken word identification.},

The English approximant and Spanish trill rhotics exhibit both a primary constriction along the palate and a secondary constriction in the pharynx. We speculate that the secondary constriction might be a cross-linguistic characteristic of rhotics and thus potentially a factor in delayed articulatory development/misarticulations. We describe an exploratory study analyzing rhotic tongue configurations in ultrasound videos from a small sample of native adult speakers of English, Malayalam, French, Persian and Spanish. Our findings confirm that rhotic sounds most subject to late development also involve tongue root movement towards a pharyngeal constriction, but this conclusion must remain tentative without further research. In the meantime, clinical strategies that include attention to primary and secondary constrictions should be explored for remediation of rhotic misarticulations across languages.},

At a time when new imaging technologies such as ultrasound continue to inform our clinical understanding of speech disorders, incorporating contemporary work in the basic articulatory sciences into clinical training becomes especially important. This is particularly the case for the speech sound most likely to persist among children with RSEs–the North American English rhotic sound, /r/. The goal of this article is to review important information about articulatory phonetics as it affects children with RSE who present with /r/ production difficulties. The data presented are largely drawn from ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging studies. This information will be placed in a clinical context by comparing productions of typical adult speakers to successful versus misarticulated productions of two children with persistent /r/ difficulties.},

This study presents a spectrographic analysis of syllable-initial rhotics as produced by ten speakers of Veracruz Mexican Spanish in a guided, semi-spontaneous speech task. Trills that show a reduction in the degree of lingual trilling usually contain an approximant phase following one or two lingual contacts, which we represent as [ɾɹ] or [rɹ] in narrow transcription. Intervocalic taps show both reduction and elision, but those with a measurable contact are short enough to maintain an acoustic difference with the longer allophones of /r/. Taken with recent studies of rhotics in Dominican Spanish, these findings suggest that the contrast between /r/ and /ɾ/ can be maintained in terms of overall segmental duration even when there is no difference in the number of lingual contacts.},

The major surviving varieties, Eastern, Central and Western Arrernte, Eastern and Western Anmatyerr, Southern and Northern Alyawarr each have several hundred to a thousand speakers, and are still being learned by many of the children, who grow up bilingual (in English) or multilingual.

It is closely related to Nis               g               a'a, and more distantly related to Coast Tsimshian and Southern Tsimshian. The specific dialect of Gitksan presented here is what can be called Eastern Gitksan, spoken in the villages of Kispiox (Ansbayaxw), Glen Vowell (Sigit'o               x               ), and Hazelton (Git-an'maaxs), which contrasts with the Western dialects, spoken in the villages of Kitwanga (Gitwin               g               a               x               ), Gitanyow (Git-anyaaw), and Kitseguecla (Gijigyukwhla). The primary phonological differences between the dialects are a lexical shift in vowels and the presence of stop lenition in the Eastern dialects. While there exists a dialect continuum, the primary cultural and political distinction drawn is between Eastern and Western Gitksan. For reference, Gitksan is bordered on the west by Nis               g               a'a, in the south by Coast Tsimshian and Witsuwit'en, in the east by Dakelh and Sekani, and in the north by Tahltan (the latter four of these being Athabaskan languages).},

  abstract = {Niuean (ISO 639-3 code niu) is a Polynesian language spoken on the island of Niue, with an additional population of speakers living in New Zealand. Figure 1 indicates where Niue is located with respect to other neighboring islands in the South Pacific. The 2011 Niue Census of Populations and Households cited the number of individuals who had either basic or fluent spoken abilities at 1121 (with 101 non-speakers) (Statistics Niue 2012). English is the second most widely used language on the island. The 2013 New Zealand census cited 4548 individuals living in New Zealand who listed Niuean as one of their languages (Statistics New Zealand 2013). Niuean is classified as ‘definitely endangered’ by UNESCO (Moseley 2010). There are historically two distinct dialects: the older Motu dialect from the northern area, and the more recent Tafiti from the southern area. These dialect differences were once reflected in slight phonological differences in vocabulary items, but the differences have since eroded in the modern language (see McEwen 1970: ix). Previous research on Niuean phonetics and phonology includes a brief outline in Seiter (1980: x), two dictionaries (McEwen 1970, Sperlich 1997), and an article on vowel length (Rolle \& Starks 2014). While these works provide an overview of some of the phenomena to be addressed below, this sketch attempts a more thorough documentation of the phonetic structures of Niuean, and provides novel acoustic and articulatory data from the language. Recordings accompanying this paper are of a male speaker (Mr. Krypton Okesene) and a female speaker (the second author).},

However, particularly for researchers concerned with sociopolitical issues in discourse, transcription is not a straightforward tool but a highly problematic yet necessary form of linguistic representation. Recent commentators have critiqued the inconsistency of researcher transcripts; by contrast, this article seeks to understand rather than remedy such variability, conceptualizing diversity in transcripts as a kind of linguistic variation. Examining four different types of variation in transcription practice — global format choices based on an analytic focus on content versus form, variation in the details of transcription format in reproducing one's own or others' transcripts, orthographic variation in a single transcript, and variation in translation — the article argues that although reflection about the transcription process cannot overcome the difficulties inherent in this methodology, it can allow scholars to be more attentive to their own transcription choices and their limitations and to make these explicit in their writing.},

  abstract = {The phenomenonof phonemicfalse evaluation has been appreciatedsince the latter part of the 19th century, when it was first observed that hearers quite often assign speech sounds produced by speakers to phonemic units different from the ones intended by speakers. This speaker-hearer mismatch had occasioned serious problems for the first linguisticanalysesof American Indian languages.Early in the 20th century, N. Trubetzkoy coined the term ‘phonemic false evaluation’, and elaborated upon it in his characterizations and comparisons of the phonological systems of a vast array of languagesof the world. Thepresent paper is an attempt to show that phonemicfalse evaluationcan represent a stumblingblock in the analysis of aphasia, since as we demonstrate, many subphonemic articulatory aberrations produced by aphasic speakers are perceived by hearers as higher level phonemic substitutions-substitutions quite often never intended by the aphasic. The theoretical and diagnostic consequences of phonemic false evaluation are subsequently considered for the description, analysis and evaluation of aphasia.},

There is ample evidence that these ‘‘electoral revolutions’’ reflected the cross-national diffusion of a distinctive model of regime change that was developed elsewhere and that was designed to promote democratization in authoritarian political contexts featuring semi-competitive elections. This electoral model spread throughout the postcommunist region because of both shared perceptions by opposition groups of similar local conditions and the existence of transnational democracy promotion networks that included local, regional and American participants. As these revolutions spread, however, they were less successful in carrying through democratic change-in part because local conditions were less supportive and in part because authoritarian leaders and their international allies were both forewarned and forearmed.},

As is the case with many indigenous languages, Northern Tepehuan is under serious threat of disappearance during the next decades as it is spoken by fewer than 9000 people (Carrillo 2011: 6) whose historical background has been one of social and linguistic marginalization. The Ódami – as the speakers of the language call themselves – live in the alpine valleys of an isolated region known as Sierra Tarahumara, a section of the Sierra Madre Occidental, in Chihuahua State, Mexico. Saucedo Sánchez de Tagle (2004: 6–9) indicates that the heart of the current Ódami territory is in some sections of the Guadalupe y Calvo municipality, in the southernmost tip of Chihuahua (see Figure 1) but speakers also can be found in the surrounding municipalities of Balleza, Guachochi and Batopilas. Approximately 80\% of Northern Tepehuan speakers live in small villages and rural settlements around the population nuclei of Baborigame, Nabogame, Llano Grande, Barbechitos and El Venadito (Saucedo Sánchez de Tagle 2004: 7). There are also some scattered speakers living in the region’s big cities of Chihuahua and Hermosillo.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The objective of this study was to examine tap production by English language learners (ELLs) in kindergarten whose 1st language is Spanish. The conflicting status of tap in Spanish and English could present challenges for allophonic learning in 2nd language for ELLs. Prior research has evaluated acquisition of other allophone pairs, but none has focused exclusively on tap.                                         Method               Thirty ELLs, 30 English monolinguals, and 29 Spanish monolinguals participated in the study. Participants completed a single-word repetition task in which numerous opportunities to produce tap were provided. Productions were phonetically transcribed and analyzed.                                         Results               The great majority of taps were pronounced correctly in both languages. The allophonic status of tap in English and phonemic status in Spanish suggest ELLs could experience negative transfer in learning; however, this was not observed. A significant interaction indicated more t/d substitutions in English and more semivowel/liquid substitutions in Spanish, contradicting the expectation of negative transfer. ELLs were also significantly more accurate at producing tap in Spanish than English.                                         Conclusion               Findings suggest that, at early kindergarten, ELL children rapidly adapted to English patterns of tap production even though Spanish and English conflict in phonemic/allophonic status of tap. This study was preliminary, and further investigation is warranted.},

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to investigate whether children with speech dysfunctions (SD) show a deficit in planning some Portuguese syllable structures (PSS) in continuous speech production. Knowledge of which aspects of speech production are affected by SD is necessary for efficient improvement in the therapy techniques. The case-study is focused on PSS as C1C2V syllable sequences (consonantconsonant-vowel), in which C2 is [l] or [r]. To identify specific speech patterns that are sensitive to SD, coarticulation effects using formant trajectories, intensity, and durational structure are investigated. To explore the characteristics of continuous speech processes in SD speech output, the methodology uses acoustic analysis. Preliminary findings show systematic specific coarticulation in the child with SD when compared to the normal speech (NS) child. This also suggests that the traditional focus on a single word production in the SD assessment needs to be modified to allow more detailed consideration of speech production in continuous speech. It is the purpose of the authors in the future to develop an application that can be an optimal start for SD treatment/counselling programmes. The work reported here proves the importance of clinic linguistic knowledge in that way. This study is the result of a multidisciplinary-team whose work allies linguist, clinical therapy and engineering knowledge.},

  abstract = {Contrary to the English /r/, which has been extensively analysed, there is very little information on the trilled consonants in Spanish. These sounds are in general diçcult to produce for young Spanish children and occur later (than other consonantsounds) in normal development. This paper describes acoustic measurements made on the trill productions in Spanish children with varying degrees of speech intelligibility. The spectral (frequency, amplitude, C±V ratio) and temporal characteristics (duration of the trill, number of open and closed periods–apertures and occlusions–and duration of these periods) were studied in 45 children (Granada, Spain) between 3.0 and 9.6 years old, divided into 5 groups. The results reveal diŒerences in spectral and temporal acoustic correlates of trill /rÅ/ among the ®ve speaker groups (e.g., the duration of the ®rst aperture period was longer for the articulatory disordered group than for the normal control group). They seem to indicate, in particular, that children who have trouble learning to make the trill sound do little more than tap the alveolar ridge. Moreover, these children seem to use more of their tongues to make these gestures; also, they do not make many trills or make them very quickly.},

  abstract = {A presente dissertação tem como principal objetivo apresentar uma descrição básica da implementação fonética de algumas oposições e categorias da fonologia da língua Tikúna. Para tanto, lançamos mão da análise de uma série de parâmetros da organização acústica dos sinais de fala produzidos sob condições controladas por 4 falantes nativos da língua, além de medidas derivadas a partir destes parâmetros.As categorias fonológicas submetidas à análise são as vogais orais, as consoantes obstruintes (oclusivas simples e africadas) e as consoantes soantes /r/ e /w/. O capítulo mais longo se dedica às vogais, no qual apresentamos os valores médios para cada um dos parâmetros de F1, F2, F3, duração e F0, e sua variação em função do contexto prosódico controlado pelo protocolo de elicitação de dados utilizado. Além de apresentarmos dados que atestam o efeito do contexto consonantal sobre a qualidade vocálica, também observamos alterações na manutenção de contrastes na região posterior do espaço vocálico em função do contexto prosódico. Apresenta-se evidências de que a oposição entre as vogais posteriores /u/ e /o/ é neutralizada em posição não-acentual na língua Tikúna. Um comportamento singular por parte das vogais anteriores /e/ e /i/ também é sugerido pelos dados, uma constatação recuperada no capítulo seguinte sobre as consoantes oclusivas. No capítulo sobre as consoantes obstruintes do Tikúna se apresentam dados relativos à alteração de parâmetros como duração da oclusão, presença ou não de vozeamento e VOT em função do contexto prosódico. Também são derivadas Equações de Lócus, que podem ser interpretadas como indicadoras do grau de articulação. A variação nas mesmas em função do contexto prosódico, do ponto de articulação e da categoria vocálica seguinte é também apresentada. No capítulo final, dedicado às consoantes soantes /r/ e /w/, apresentamos dados relativos à duração das oclusões, a manutenção de vozeamento, além de evidências que atestam alterações de modo de articulação. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ABSTRACT},

Phonetic featural differences are considered in order to evaluate the proposed implicational hierarchy of Dinnsen et al.’s phonetic inventory typology for English. The children’s phonetic inventories are examined independently and in relation to one another. Five hierarchical complexity levels are proposed, similar to those of English and other languages, although with some language-specific differences. These findings have implications for theoretical assumptions about the universality of phonetic inventory development, and for remediation of Spanish-speaking children with phonological impairments.},

  abstract = {Descriptive grammars are our main vehicle for documenting and analysing the linguistic structure of the world's 6,000 languages. They bring together, in one place, a coherent treatment of how the whole language works, and therefore form the primary source of information on a given language, consulted by a wide range of users: areal specialists, typologists, theoreticians of any part of language (syntax, morphology, phonology, historical linguistics etc.), and members of the speech communities concerned. The writing of a descriptive grammar is a major intellectual challenge, that calls on the grammarian to balance a respect for the language's distinctive genius with an awareness of how other languages work, to combine rigour with readability, to depict structural regularities while respecting a corpus of real material, and to represent something of the native speaker's competence while recognising the variation inherent in any speech community. Despite a recent surge of awareness of the need to document little-known languages, there is no book that focusses on the manifold issues that face the author of a descriptive grammar. This volume brings together contributors who approach the problem from a range of angles. Most have written descriptive grammars themselves, but others represent different types of reader. Among the topics they address are: overall issues of grammar design, the complementary roles of outsider and native speaker grammarians, the balance between grammar and lexicon, cross-linguistic comparability, the role of explanation in grammatical description, the interplay of theory and a range of fieldwork methods in language description, the challenges of describing languages in their cultural and historical context, and the tensions between linguistic particularity, established practice of particular schools of linguistic description and the need for a universally commensurable analytic framework. This book will renew the field of grammaticography, addressing a multiple readership of descriptive linguists, typologists, and formal linguists, by bringing together a range of distinguished practitioners from around the world to address these questions.},

The corpus is particularly intended for the study of rhotics as a sociolinguistic variable in the production of Sicilian speakers. Rhotics are analyzed according to the distinction between single-phase and multiple-phase rhotics along with the presence of constriction and aperture articulatory phases. Based on these parameters, the annotation protocol seeks to classify rhotic variants within a sufficiently granular, but internally consistent, phonetic perspective. The proposed descriptive parameters allow for the discussion of atypical realizations in terms of phonetic derivations (or simplifications) of typical closure–aperture sequences. The distribution of fricative variants in the speech repertoire of one speaker and his interlocutors shows the potential provided by SoPhISM for sociophonetic variation to be studied at the ‘micro’ level of individual speaker’s idiolects.},

Aside from the case system, one of the topics that is attracting much attention lately is the reconstruction of person suffixes. Within this area, the hypothesis has been suggested by some and proposed explicitly by others, that *Q could have had an isomorphic shape for marking person allocation and action. As for the category of plural in the verb system, the idea became consensual among specialists that *Q, as the Aru languages today, did not have the category of plural as obligatory. Furthermore, its absence did not mean singularity necessarily. In the present paper, I will provide evidence for postulating an isomorphic marker for person allocation and action. In .regard to number, I will also provide a hypothesis concerning the emergence of the inclusive suffix *-n-dik. In both cases, the proposal rests upon crucial dialectal and documental evidence.},

In brief, the results show that: (1) The difference in relative energy between the first two poles distinguishes /1/ (⩾ 20 dB) from /R/ (⩽ 15 dB). (2) The envelope curve of both sounds is characterized by the presence of one or more spectral zeroes whose number, bandwidth, and frequency location are dependent on the adjoining vowel. A set of simple rules that sum up these differences is presented and emphasis is put upon the need for using other acoustic criteria to further inquire into the distinction between /1/ and /R/ in certain contexts.},

Baram plosives are acoustically characterized by VOT, the fricatives by the peak value and the affricates by the rise time and friction duration. Similarly, the nasals, lateral, trill and glides are characterized by formant structure. Similarly, the distribution of the F1 and F2 reveals the height of the tongue and frontness/backness of the vowels. The height of the vowels is also depicted by their intrinsic F0 as it increases as the height of the vowel increases. Baram has five diphthongs which are close diphthongs and the second target is always [i].},

We argue that a fundamental constraint on memory, the Now-or-Never bottleneck, implies that language processing is incremental and that language learning occurs on-line. These properties are difficult to reconcile with the ‘abstract knowledge’ viewpoint, and crucially suggest that language comprehension and production are facets of a unitary skill. This viewpoint is exemplified in the Chunk-Based Learner, a computational acquisition model that processes incrementally and learns on-line. The model both parses and produces language; and implements the idea that language acquisition is nothing more than learning to process. We suggest that the Now-or-Never bottleneck also provides a strong motivation for unified perception–production models in other domains of communication and cognition.},

The current study thus sets out to develop elicitation and analysis tools for Tagalog. A picture elicitation task was designed with a warm-up, screener and two extension lists, one with more complex and one with simpler words. A nonlinear phonological analysis form was adapted from English (Bernhardt \& Stemberger, 2000) to capture key characteristics of Tagalog. The tools were piloted on a primarily Tagalog-speaking 4-year-old boy living in a CanadianEnglish-speaking environment. The data provided initial guidance for revision of the elicitation tool (available at phonodevelopment.sites.olt. ubc.ca). The analysis provides preliminary observations about possible expectations for primarily Tagalog-speaking 4-year-olds in Englishspeaking environments: Lack of mastery for tap/trill ‘r’, and minor mismatches for vowels, /l/, /h/ and word stress. Further research is required in order to develop the tool into a norm-referenced instrument for Tagalog in both monolingual and multilingual environments.},

Most native speakers of Shanghai Chinese are in fact descendants of immigrants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces who moved to Shanghai in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. More recently, the position of Shanghai Chinese has been eroded with the influx of immigrants from other parts of the country and the widespread adoption of Standard Chinese.},

Using data from multiple speakers of 18 languages, all of which were recorded and analyzed in the same way, we show that most, but not all, of the within language place of articulation variation can be described by universally applicable phonetic rules (although the physiological bases for these rules are not entirely clear). The between language variation is also largely (but not entirely) predictable by assuming that languages choose one of the three possibilities for the degree of aspiration of voiceless stops. Some languages, however, have VOTs that are markedly different from the generally observed values. The phonetic output of a grammar has to contain language specific components to account for these results.},

Further, differences in speech development across languages can help to understand how the phonological systems of ambient languages affects children’s speech acquisition. To date, little is known about Danish. It was suggested, however, that the acquisition process might be slower for Danish-speaking children due to the “blurry” sound structure of Danish. The aim of the current study was, therefore, to investigate typical speech development in 443 Danish-speaking children, i.e. types and age of occurrence of children’s phonological processes as well as on the acquisition of phones and clusters. The results showed that Danish-speaking children, in contrast to the expectations, were not delayed but advanced compared to children acquiring other languages.},

  abstract = {A vast variety of biological, social, and economical networks shows topologies drastically differing from random graphs; yet the quantitative characterization remains unsatisfactory from a conceptual point of view. Motivated from the discussion of small scale-free networks, a biased link distribution entropy is defined, which takes an extremum for a powerlaw distribution. This approach is extended to the node–node link cross-distribution, whose nondiagonal elements characterize the graph structure beyond link distribution, cluster coefficient and average path length. From here a simple (and computationally cheap) complexity measure can be defined. This offdiagonal complexity (OdC) is proposed as a novel measure to characterize the complexity of an undirected graph, or network. While both for regular lattices and fully connected networks OdC is zero, it takes a moderately low value for a random graph and shows high values for apparently complex structures as scale-free networks and hierarchical trees. The OdC approach is applied to the Helicobacter pylori protein interaction network and randomly rewired surrogates.},

  abstract = {Preaspirated voiceless stops, a well-documented feature of Scottish Gaelic (Ní Chasaide 1985, Clayton 2010, Nance \& Stuart-Smith 2013), have also been reported in the English spoken in the Hebrides island chain (Borgstrøm 1940, Wells 1982, Shuken 1984). However, a detailed description of preaspiration in Hebrides English has previously been unavailable. This paper presents the results of a phonetic study of preaspirated voiceless stops in Hebrides English, based on the speech of 24 English–Scottish Gaelic bilinguals from nine regions within the Hebrides island chain. The paper describes the effect of linguistic features on the duration and frequency of preaspiration, including place of articulation, word position, and vowel context. The paper also considers the role of social factors, including speakers’ geographic origin, age, and gender, finding that preaspiration is more frequent among women and among older speakers, especially older female speakers from Lewis. The paper concludes that preaspiration is likely to be an obsolescent feature in Hebrides English, rather than an innovative feature as in other varieties of English such as Tyneside or Aberystwyth (Docherty \& Foulkes 1999, Foulkes, Docherty \& Watt 2001, Hejná 2015).},

  abstract = {This paper presents a descriptive study of nasals and nasal harmony in Ikwere, an Igboid language of Nigeria. In the variety studied here, nasality is surface-contrastive in vowels but not in consonants. Nasality has the status of a morpheme-level feature which is either present or absent in each morpheme (root or affix). If present, it is predictably distributed across nonobstruent sounds by a system of nasal harmony which operates within the domain of the simple word, spreading nasality bidirectionally until blocked by an obstruent. The class of nasalizing sounds includes the nonexplosive stops ḅ and ’ḅ ~, confirming results of an earlier study showing these sounds to be nonobstruents (Clements and Osu 2002). The analysis brings to light some of the basic typological parameters that characterize nasal harmony in Ikwere, as well as an idiosyncratic restriction to the “phonological root”, a domain which excludes initial syllables in noun roots that are homophonous with prefixes in other words. The paper concludes with a summary and discussion of implications for the feature analysis and typology of stops.},

An acoustic experimental study shows that although the Hebrew rhotic phoneme tends to be a dorsal approximant, it is significantly more likely to undergo fortition in onset position. This fortition is a result of target overshoot, the rhotic subsequently being produced with a greater degree of constriction than that which would have resulted in an approximant, subsequently surfacing as a stop, a fricative, a tap or a trill. Furthermore, in onset position, female speakers show more variation and produce fewer approximants than male speakers.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the role of allophonic variation in phoneme acquisition and the clinical implications of this role. Specifically, we investigate the Hebrew rhotic /ʁ/. We analyse its production by Hebrew-acquiring children in various corpora, comparing the deletion, substitution and production in word-initial onset, intervocalic and wordfinal coda positions. The results are compared to the frequency of rhotics in a child-directed speech (CDS) corpus and in a Hebrew lexicon analysis. The study shows rhotics are acquired first in word-final codas, then in intervocalic position and finally as word-initial onsets. The order of acquisition, demonstrated by the deletion and substitution patterns, and the actual production of Hebrew rhotics correlate with the degree of allophonic variation. It does not, however, correlate with the frequency patterns observed in CDS and the Hebrew lexicon. Further study of allophonic variation and acquisition should include additional phonemes in Hebrew, as well as other languages.},

Our own preliminary and impressionistic work suggests the number of Ega speakers to be closer to the upper end of this range, perhaps around 2,000, but we note that Ega now serves a decreasing number of sociolinguistic functions, to the extent that in at least some villages Dida has replaced Ega as the primary language of daily use. It is also clear that the degree of intergenerational transmission is low in many, if not all, Ega villages.},

Linguistically, many of these refugee communities are of Palestinian Arabic dialect backgrounds, although varieties of Arabic spoken in the Nagab are classified as originating in the Hijaz area of what is today Saudi Arabia (see Shahin 2007 on Palestinian Arabic and Henkin 2010 on Nagab Arabic).},

  abstract = {Language is universal, but it has few indisputably universal characteristics, with cross-linguistic variation being the norm. For example, languages differ greatly in the number of syllables they allow, resulting in large variation in the Shannon information per syllable. Nevertheless, all natural languages allow their speakers to efficiently encode and transmit information. We show here, using quantitative methods on a large cross-linguistic corpus of 17 languages, that the coupling between language-level (information per syllable) and speaker-level (speech rate) properties results in languages encoding similar information rates (\textasciitilde 39 bits/s) despite wide differences in each property individually: Languages are more similar in information rates than in Shannon information or speech rate. These findings highlight the intimate feedback loops between languages’ structural properties and their speakers’ neurocognition and biology under communicative pressures. Thus, language is the product of a multiscale communicative niche construction process at the intersection of biology, environment, and culture.},

Although its genetic affiliation with these other, now-moribund Polish varieties is uncontested, Mennonite Plautdietsch represents an exceptional member of this grouping. It was adopted as the language of in-group communication by Mennonites escaping religious persecution in northwestern and central Europe during the mid-sixteenth century, and later accompanied these pacifist Anabaptist Christians over several successive generations of emigration and exile through Poland, Ukraine, and parts of the Russian Empire. As a result of this extensive migration history, Mennonite Plautdietsch is spoken today in diasporic speech communities on four continents and in over a dozen countries by an estimated 300,000 people, primarily descendants of these so-called Russian Mennonites (Epp 1993, Lewis 2009).},

This study includes (1) a physiological analysis of videofiberscopic laryngeal data from a healthy Mongolian singer and from three non-singer French-speaking clinical patients; and (2) an acoustical analysis (fundamental frequency and intensity). For the singer, the fiberoptic analysis showed two main laryngeal behaviours in producing ornamentations: (1) ‘lyrical’ vibratos mobilising the entire laryngeal block; (2) ‘Mongolian’ trills with essentially supraglottic movements, the arytenoids being mobilised independently of the rest of the laryngeal block. Patients demonstrated similar aryepiglottic trilling to fulfil a function of voicing. The acoustic analysis showed that the fundamental frequency and the intensity were in phase for vibrato, contrary to the ‘Mongolian’ trills which were in opposite phase, underlying a change of laryngeal vibratory mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Both qualitative concepts and quantitative methods from evolutionary biology have been applied to linguistics. Many linguists have noted the similarity between biological evolution and language change, but usually have employed only selective analogies or metaphors. The development of generalized theories of evolutionary change (Dawkins and Hull) has spawned models of language change on the basis of such generalized theories. These models have led to the positing of new mechanisms of language change and new types of selection that may not have biological parallels. Quantitative methods have been applied to questions of language phylogeny in the past decade. Research has focused on widely accepted families with cognates already established by the comparative method (Indo-European, Bantu, Austronesian). Increasingly sophisticated phylogeny reconstruction models have been applied to these families to resolve questions of subgrouping, contact, and migration. Little progress has been made so far in analyzing sound correspondences in the cognates themselves.},

  abstract = {The bouba/kiki effect—the association of the nonce word bouba with a round shape and kiki with a spiky shape—is a type of correspondence between speech sounds and visual properties with potentially deep implications for the evolution of spoken language. However, there is debate over the robustness of the effect across cultures and the influence of orthography. We report an online experiment that tested the bouba/kiki effect across speakers of 25 languages representing nine language families and 10 writing systems. Overall, we found strong evidence for the effect across languages, with bouba eliciting more congruent responses than kiki. Participants who spoke languages with Roman scripts were only marginally more likely to show the effect, and analysis of the orthographic shape of the words in different scripts showed that the effect was no stronger for scripts that use rounder forms for bouba and spikier forms for kiki. These results confirm that the bouba/kiki phenomenon is rooted in crossmodal correspondence between aspects of the voice and visual shape, largely independent of orthography. They provide the strongest demonstration to date that the bouba/kiki effect is robust across cultures and writing systems. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Voice modulation: from origin and mechanism to social impact (Part II)’.},

  abstract = {Human language is unparalleled in both its expressive capacity and its diversity. What accounts for the enormous diversity of human languages [13]? Recent evidence suggests that the structure of languages may be shaped by the social and demographic environment in which the languages are learned and used. In an analysis of over 2000 languages Lupyan and Dale [25] demonstrated that socio-demographic variables, such as population size, significantly predicted the complexity of inflectional morphology. Languages spoken by smaller populations tend to employ more complex inflectional systems. Languages spoken by larger populations tend to avoid complex morphological paradigms, employing lexical constructions instead. This relationship may exist because of how language learning takes place in these different social contexts [44, 45]. In a smaller population, a tightly-knit social group combined with exclusive or almost exclusive language acquisition by infants permits accumulation of complex inflectional forms. In larger populations, adult language learning and more extensive cross-group interactions produce pressures that lead to morphological simplification. In the current paper, we explore this learning-based hypothesis in two ways. First, we develop an agent-based simulation that serves as a simple existence proof: As adult interaction increases, languages lose inflections. Second, we carry out a correlational study showing that English-speaking adults who had more interaction with non-native speakers as children showed a relative preference for over-regularized (i.e. morphologically simpler) forms. The results of the simulation and experiment lend support to the linguistic niche hypothesis: Languages may vary in the ways they do in part due to different social environments in which they are learned and used. In short, languages adapt to the learning constraints and biases of their learners.},

  abstract = {It is essential to complete palate closure at the correct time during fetal development, otherwise a serious malformation, cleft palate, will ensue. The steps in palate formation in humans take place between the 7th and 12th week and consist of outgrowth of palatal shelves from the paired maxillary prominences, reorientation of the shelves from vertical to horizontal, apposition of the medial surfaces, formation of a bilayered seam, degradation of the seam and bridging of mesenchyme. However, in the soft palate, the mechanism of closure is unclear. In previous studies it is possible to find support for both fusion and the alternative mechanism of merging. Here we densely sample the late embryonic-early fetal period between 54 and 74 days post-conception to determine the timing and mechanism of soft palate closure. We found the epithelial seam extends throughout the soft palates of 57-day specimens. Cytokeratin antibody staining detected the medial edge epithelium and distinguished clearly that cells in the midline retained their epithelial character. Compared with the hard palate, the epithelium is more rapidly degraded in the soft palate and only persists in the most posterior regions at 64 days. Our results are consistent with the soft palate following a developmentally more rapid program of fusion than the hard palate. Importantly, the two regions of the palate appear to be independently regulated and have their own internal clocks regulating the timing of seam removal. Considering data from human genetic and mouse studies, distinct anterior-posterior signaling mechanisms are likely to be at play in the human fetal palate.},

In particular, languages have been shown to encode meaning distinctions in their sound properties, which may be important for language learning. Here, we investigate the relationship between semantic distance and phonological distance in the large-scale structure of the lexicon. We show evidence in 100 languages from a diverse array of language families that more semantically similar word pairs are also more phonologically similar. This suggests that there is an important statistical trend for lexicons to have semantically similar words be phonologically similar as well, possibly for functional reasons associated with language learning.},

  abstract = {Language is the best example of a cultural evolutionary system, able to retain a phylogenetic signal over many thousands of years. The temporal stability (conservatism) of basic vocabulary is relatively well understood, but the stability of the structural properties of language (phonology, morphology, syntax) is still unclear. Here we report an extensive Bayesian phylogenetic investigation of the structural stability of numerous features across many language families and we introduce a novel method for analyzing the relationships between the ‘‘stability profiles’’ of language families. We found that there is a strong universal component across language families, suggesting the existence of universal linguistic, cognitive and genetic constraints. Against this background, however, each language family has a distinct stability profile, and these profiles cluster by geographic area and likely deep genealogical relationships. These stability profiles seem to show, for example, the ancient historical relationships between the Siberian and American language families, presumed to be separated by at least 12,000 years, and possible connections between the Eurasian families. We also found preliminary support for the punctuated evolution of structural features of language across families, types of features and geographic areas. Thus, such higher-level properties of language seen as an evolutionary system might allow the investigation of ancient connections between languages and shed light on the peopling of the world.},

  abstract = {It is usually assumed that modern language is a recent phenomenon, coinciding with the emergence of modern humans themselves. Many assume as well that this is the result of a single, sudden mutation giving rise to the full “modern package.” However, we argue here that recognizably modern language is likely an ancient feature of our genus pre-dating at least the common ancestor of modern humans and Neandertals about half a million years ago. To this end, we adduce a broad range of evidence from linguistics, genetics, paleontology, and archaeology clearly suggesting that Neandertals shared with us something like modern speech and language. This reassessment of the antiquity of modern language, from the usually quoted 50,000–100,000 years to half a million years, has profound consequences for our understanding of our own evolution in general and especially for the sciences of speech and language. As such, it argues against a saltationist scenario for the evolution of language, and toward a gradual process of culture-gene co-evolution extending to the present day. Another consequence is that the present-day linguistic diversity might better reflect the properties of the design space for language and not just the vagaries of history, and could also contain traces of the languages spoken by other human forms such as the Neandertals.},

The chapter begins by highlighting several still common misconceptions about language that might seem to call into question a cultural evolutionary approach. It explores the antiquity of language and sketches a general evolutionary approach discussing the aspects of function, tness, replication, and selection, as well the relevant units of linguistic evolution. In this context, the chapter looks at some fundamental aspects of linguistic diversity such as the nature of the design space, the mechanisms generating it, and the shape and fabric of language. Given that biology is another evolutionary system, its complex coevolution with language needs to be understood in order to have a proper theory of language. Throughout the chapter, various challenges are identi ed and discussed, sketching promising directions for future research. The chapter ends by listing the necessary data, methods, and theoretical developments required for a grounded evolutionary approach to language.},

  abstract = {The recent Bayesian approaches to language evolution and change seem to suggest that genetic biases can impact on the characteristics of language, but, at the same time, that its cultural transmission can partially free it from these same genetic constraints. One of the current debates centres on the striking differences between sampling and a posteriori maximising Bayesian learners, with the first converging on the prior bias while the latter allows a certain freedom to language evolution. The present paper shows that this difference disappears if populations more complex than a single teacher and a single learner are considered, with the resulting behaviours more similar to the sampler. This suggests that generalisations based on the language produced by Bayesian agents in such homogeneous single agent chains are not warranted. It is not clear which of the assumptions in such models are responsible, but these findings seem to support the rising concerns on the validity of the ‘‘acquisitionist’’ assumption, whereby the locus of language change and evolution is taken to be the first language acquirers (children) as opposed to the competent language users (the adults).},

  abstract = {Language is not a purely cultural phenomenon somehow isolated from its wider environment, and we may only understand its origins and evolution by seriously considering its embedding in this environment as well as its multimodal nature. By environment here we understand other aspects of culture (such as communication technology, attitudes towards language contact, etc.), of the physical environment (ultraviolet light incidence, air humidity, etc.), and of the biological infrastructure for language and speech. We are specifically concerned in this paper with the latter, in the form of the biases, constraints and affordances that the anatomy and physiology of the vocal tract create on speech and language. In a nutshell, our argument is that (a) there is an under-appreciated amount of inter-individual variation in vocal tract (VT) anatomy and physiology, (b) variation that is non-randomly distributed across populations, and that (c) results in systematic differences in phonetics and phonology between languages. Relevant differences in VT anatomy include the overall shape of the hard palate, the shape of the alveolar ridge, the relationship between the lower and upper jaw, to mention just a few, and our data offer a new way to systematically explore such differences and their potential impact on speech. These differences generate very small biases that nevertheless can be amplified by the repeated use and transmission of language, affecting language diachrony and resulting in crosslinguistic synchronic differences. Moreover, the same type of biases and processes might have played an essential role in the emergence and evolution of language, and might allow us a glimpse into the speech and language of extinct humans by, for example, reconstructing the anatomy of parts of their vocal tract from the fossil record and extrapolating the biases we find in present-day humans.},

It is still debated whether structural features have intrinsic stabilities across language families and geographic areas, or if the processes governing their rate of change are completely dependent upon the specific context of a given language or language family. We conducted an extensive literature review and selected seven different approaches to conceptualising and estimating the stability of structural linguistic features, aiming at comparing them using the same dataset, the World Atlas of Language Structures. We found that, despite profound conceptual and empirical differences between these methods, they tend to agree in classifying some structural linguistic features as being more stable than others. This suggests that there are intrinsic properties of such structural features influencing their stability across methods, language families and geographic areas. This finding is a major step towards understanding the nature of structural linguistic features and their interaction with idiosyncratic, lineage- and area-specific factors during language change and evolution.},

Of the population of about 400,000 in Brunei, about two-thirds are native speakers of Brunei Malay (Clynes 2001), and the language is generally used as a lingua franca between the other ethnic groups (Martin 1996), so even most Chinese Bruneians, numbering about 45,000 (Dunseath 1996), are reasonably proficient in Brunei Malay. Although Standard Malay is promoted as the national language of Brunei (Clynes \& Deterding 2011), in fact it is only used in formal situations, such as government speeches and television and radio broadcasts (Martin 1996). The language that is spoken most extensively is Brunei Malay, though English is also widely used by the educated elite (Deterding \& Salbrina 2013).},

This Element provides an overview of existing descriptions of the pronunciation of Standard Malay before briefly considering the pronunciation of some dialects of Malay. It then introduces materials that may be used for studying the phonetics of Malay: a short text, the North Wind and the Sun (NWS) passage; and a map task, to generate conversational data. Based on recordings using these materials by two female and two male consultants who are academics at Universiti Brunei Darussalam, the Element next offers an acoustic analysis of the consonants and vowels of Malay, the syllable structure arising from fast speech processes, as well as the rhythm and intonation of the Standard Malay that is spoken in Brunei. Finally, it suggests directions for further research on the phonetics of Malay.},

To better understand their application in vocal clinic, the aim of this literature review was to identify the voiced tongue and lip vibration technique on the classification, main indications, clinical results and technical performance duration. Literature search was conducted in PubMed platform, portal CAPES and Google Scholar search site. There were included original articles, literature reviews, congress proceedings, dissertations and thesis that addressed the sonorous lips or tongue vibration technique, published in the last 10 years, in Portuguese or English. There were excluded books and editorials. Articles whose technique was only cited without approach on immediate vocal or laryngeal effects, forms of use or clinical results were also excluded. Initially, were found 42 publications. After the steps of selection by title and abstract, there remained 20 original articles, 1 literature review and 5 dissertations. The publications analyzed showed that the voiced tongue and lip vibration technique is classified as an exercise of semi-occluded vocal tract, which softens the contact between the vocal folds, balances the subglottal and supraglottal pressure, optimizes the mucus-wave motion and increases vocal resistance. Its main indications are for vocal warm up, occupational use of voice, hyperkinetic dysphonia and mass lesions in the vocal folds.},

We acknowledge many recent advances and the abundant research on several classic topics, such as phonology, morphosyntax, and discourse. We also highlight the need for research on understudied phenomena and emphasize the importance of combining both quantitative and ethnographic methodologies in sociolinguistic research. Much research on Spanish has shown that the language’s wide variation across the globe is a reflection of Spanish-speaking communities’ rich sociohistorical and demographic diversity. Yet, there are many areas where research is needed, including bilingualism in indigenous communities, access to bilingual education, attitudes toward speakers of indigenous languages, and language maintenance and attrition. Language policy, ideology, and use in the legal and health care systems have also become important topics of sociolinguistics today as they relate to issues of human rights.},

According to the 2005 census (INEGI 2005), there are 1,345 inhabitants in the town, virtually all of whom speak Itunyoso Trique as a native language. However, this number does not reflect the total number of speakers, as approximately 30\%–50\% of the population lives outside of San Martín Itunyoso at any given time. The population of the nearby town of Concepción Itunyoso, with a population of 261 (ibid.), is considered to speak the same dialect. The remaining populations of speakers are found in Oaxaca City, Mexico City, and the United States.},

CLP can occur in isolation or as part of a broad range of chromosomal, Mendelian or teratogenic syndromes. Although there has been marked progress in identifying genetic and environmental triggers for syndromic CLP, the aetiology of the more common non-syndromic (isolated) forms remains poorly characterized. Recently, using a combination of epidemiology, careful phenotyping, genome-wide association studies and analysis of animal models, several distinct genetic and environmental risk factors have been identified and confirmed for non-syndromic CLP. These findings have advanced our understanding of developmental biology and created new opportunities for clinical translational research.},

After eliminating likely loans, about 460 cognate sets are established. From study of the phonetic character and distribution of sets of sound correspondences, the phonological system of Proto-Arawá is reconstructed. A number of unusual correspondence sets suggest the existence of a small substratum vocabulary within Paumarí, possibly from an Arawá group speaking a distinct language, whose members merged with the Paumarí tribe. There is no evidence for genetic relationship between the Arawá family and either Arawak or any other recognized language family.},

Nothofer (1994) places Gayo along with Nias, Mentawai, Enggano and the various Batak languages in a North-West Sumatra/Barrier Islands subgroup. Five distinct but mutually intelligible dialects are recognised within Gayo: Bukit, Dëret, Cik, Serbejadi and Lues.},

  abstract = {The syllable is a natural unit of organization in spoken language whose strongest cross-linguistic patterns are often explained in terms of a universal preference for the CV structure. Syllable patterns involving long sequences of consonants are both typologically rare and theoretically marginalized, with few approaches treating these as natural or unproblematic structures. This book is an investigation of the properties of languages with highly complex syllable patterns. The two aims are (i) to establish whether these languages share other linguistic features in common such that they constitute a distinct linguistic type, and (ii) to identify possible diachronic paths and natural mechanisms by which these patterns come about in the history of a language. These issues are investigated in a diversified sample of 100 languages, 25 of which have highly complex syllable patterns. Languages with highly complex syllable structure are characterized by a number of phonetic, phonological, and morphological features which serve to set them apart from languages with simpler syllable patterns. These include specific segmental and suprasegmental properties, a higher prevalence of vowel reduction processes with extreme outcomes, and higher average morpheme/word ratios. The results suggest that highly complex syllable structure is a linguistic type distinct from but sharing some characteristics with other proposed holistic phonological types, including stress-timed and consonantal languages. The results point to word stress and specific patterns of gestural organization as playing important roles in the diachronic development of these patterns out of simpler syllable structures.},

Sandawe has been widely assumed to be a member of the Khoisan language family, but recent research has cast doubt on the position that such a family exists (Güldemann \& Vossen 2000). The Sandawe language can be divided into an eastern variety and a western variety. The differences between these two varieties are slight and gradual. The orthography used in the following description was decided upon in 2002 by a group of Sandawe speakers representing different parts of the language area. Early research on Sandawe phonetics and phonology was undertaken by Dempwolff (1916) and Copland (1938). More recent studies are found in Tucker \& Bryan (1977), Elderkin (1989, 1992), Wright, Maddieson, Ladefoged \& Sands (1995), Maddieson, Ladefoged \& Sands (1999) and Hunziker, Hunziker \& Eaton (2005).},

  abstract = {The Bai language (                              ) is spoken by approximately 1.6 million people in northwest Yunnan Province, China. Of the 25 minority languages spoken in Yunnan, where 33\% of the population are ethnic minorities and 67\% are Han Chinese, the Bai ethnic minority is second in population only to the Yi (Wiersma 1990, 2003; 2010 census). Bai is classified as a Tibeto-Burman language (Xu \& Zhao 1964, 1984), although arguments have been raised as to its possible early Sinitic origins (Starostin 1994, 1995). A summary in French reviews Chinese loanwords, ancient Bai, and comparative Bai dialects (Dell 1981). The historical influence of Chinese on Bai has been significant, but evidence is not compelling that Bai is Sinitic (Norman 2003: 73). There are three major dialects of Bái: Jiànchuān (                              ), Dàlĭ (                              ), and Bìjiāng (                              ). The data in this illustration represent the variety of Jianchuan (jian1239, BCA). The third author (                              ), who was about 60 years old at the time of recording, is a male native of the Jianchuan region, originating from QiÁohǒu, a mountain village some 50 km southwest of Jianchuan city – a remote area known for salt mining and where the language has been less influenced by modern Chinese. These locations are indicated on the map of Yunnan (the southwesternmost province of China in an intensely minority-language-populated area) in Figure~1. The traditional geographical link from Qiaohou is to Jianchuan to the north rather than to Dali to the south, and many of the most distinctive characteristics of Jianchuan Bai described here are not found in Dali Bai.},

  abstract = {The Nuosu (Nosu) Yi language, or Northern Yi (北部彝语), is spoken by approximately two million people in southern Sichuan Province and northern Yunnan Province, China, the majority of whom are monolingual. Yi is a member of the Yi Branch of the Lolo-Burmese subgroup of the Tibeto-Burman family (Benedict 1972/2009, Bradley 1979), which includes some 50 languages, also called the Nisoic languages (Lama 2012) or Ngwi Group. The large (5 million) ethnic Yi nationality groups of Yunnan Province are distantly related. The third author, Lama Ziwo, who was 31 at the time of recording, produced, translated and transcribed the recorded audio data phonemically and participated in the laryngoscopic filming of the video data. He is a native speaker of the Suondip/Suondi dialect, and a fluent speaker of the Shypnra/Shengza dialect. It is the Shypnra/Shengza standard dialect that is being represented in this paper. The most distinguishing phonetic feature of Northern Yi is its systematic vocal register contrast (Matisoff 1972, Dai 1990) between two settings of the laryngeal constrictor mechanism, which are referred to as a lax (unconstricted) series and a tense (constricted) series (Edmondson et al. 2000, 2001). The contrast is realized as a distinction in resonance (spectral quality) rather than as contrasting phonation types as in some other forms of Yi or in other Tibeto-Burman languages (e.g. Bai). The consonantal inventory is large, with complex vocalic interactions, including interactions with two pairs of fricativized vowels. Northern Yi has 43 initial consonants, five pairs of vowels (or syllable rhymes), and three tones: 55, 33, and 21. Relevant reports on voice quality in related languages can be found in Maddieson \& Ladefoged (1985) and Sun \& Liu (1986).},

  abstract = {This paper presents an acoustic analysis of Mixean Low Navarrese, an endangered variety of Basque. The manuscript includes an overview of previous acoustic studies performed on different Basque varieties in order to synthesize the sparse acoustic descriptions of the language that are available. This synthesis serves as a basis for the acoustic analysis performed in the current study, in which the various acoustic analyses given in previous studies are replicated in a single, cohesive general acoustic description of Mixean Basque. The analyses include formant and duration measurements for the six-vowel system, voice onset time measurements for the three-way stop system, spectral center of gravity for the sibilants, and number of lingual contacts in the alveolar rhotic tap and trill. Important findings include: a centralized realization ([ʉ]) of the high-front rounded vowel usually described as /y/; a data-driven confirmation of the three-way laryngeal opposition in the stop system; evidence in support of an alveolo-palatal to apical sibilant merger; and the discovery of a possible incipient merger of rhotics. These results show how using experimental acoustic methods to study under-represented linguistic varieties can result in revelations of sound patterns otherwise undescribed in more commonly studied varieties of the same language.},

  doi = {10.13140/RG.2.2.36245.55529},
  abstract = {All languages change, and these changes are often induced by language contact. A common contact-induced change is lexical borrowing, the introduction of a foreign word into a language. When a foreign sound is introduced to a language through lexical borrowing, the language is said to have borrowed a phonological segment, i.e., a contrastive speech sound. So far, the phenomenon of phonological segment borrowing has not been the object of a wide-scale typological study. This work introduces SEGBO, a first-of-its-kind database of borrowed segments in the world’s languages, that addresses this lacuna (Grossman et al. 2020). I present a descriptive analysis of the data collected so far, focusing on prominent target and source languages and frequently borrowed segments, both globally and areally. The second part of this work presents three studies that tackle focused research questions regarding segment borrowing, demonstrating various ways in which the SEGBO data can be utilized. These studies address the notion of borrowability, the role of phonological features in borrowing, and the borrowing of rhotic phonemes. This work demonstrates the broad spectrum of possibilities for research that can be made using SEGBO, and sheds light on a hitherto under-explored domain at the intersection of phonology, language change, typology and language contact.},

It is shown that tapped nasals and tapped laterals are to be found in some other languages of the lower basin of the Niger. However, length or duration is also a primary differentiating feature between lenis and non-lenis sounds (other factors such as “muscular tension” and “force of articulation” being difficult to pin down). Therefore, taps and lenis sounds which share the same phonetic correlates should be described in terms of a multivalued feature [length], following Williamson (1976). Sounds of normal duration would be [0 length] while shorter-than-normal sounds are [–1 length]. Long or so-called fortis sounds would be [1 length].},

An app-based training on using ultrasound biofeedback technology to help improve pronunciation of the Spanish trill /r/ was developed for remote presentation over a Zoom-based pronunciation class for collegiate learners of Spanish. Participating students shared their opinions about the material that they learned through semi-structured discussion questions. The perspectives of these students showed overall themes of visualization of the tongue, the ability to understand and explain the concepts, integration of sonographic tongue information in teaching, and the difference of in-person learning and app-based learning. In all, this study provided preliminary data on the perspectives of learners of Spanish in regards to using ultrasound biofeedback technology for pronunciation practice of the trill.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) tongue model has been developed using MR images of a reference subject producing 44 artificially sustained Swedish articulations. Based on the difference in tongue shape between the articulations and a reference, the six linear parameters jaw height, tongue body, tongue dorsum, tongue tip, tongue advance and tongue width were determined using an ordered linear factor analysis controlled by articulatory measures. The first five factors explained 88\% of the tongue data variance in the midsagittal plane and 78\% in the 3D analysis. The six-parameter model is able to reconstruct the modelled articulations with an overall mean reconstruction error of 0.13 cm, and it specifically handles lateral differences and asymmetries in tongue shape. In order to correct articulations that were hyperarticulated due to the artificial sustaining in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition, the parameter values in the tongue model were readjusted based on a comparison of virtual and natural linguopalatal contact patterns, collected with electropalatography (EPG). Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) data was collected to control the kinematics of the tongue model for vowel-fricative sequences and an algorithm to handle surface contacts has been implemented, preventing the tongue from protruding through the palate and teeth. Résumé Un modèle à trois dimensions de la langue a été élaboré à partir des images obtenues par Résonance Magnétique (IRM) sur un sujet prononçant 44 articulations suédoises. En s’appuyant sur la différence entre les contours de la langue mesurés pour les différentes articulations et une position de référence, six paramètres de contrôle de la mâchoire et la langue ont été déterminés par application d’une analyse factorielle sur des mesures articulatoires. Les cinq premiers facteurs ont expliqué 88\% de la variance des contours de la langue dans le plan sagittal et 78\% de la variance tri-dimensionnelle. Ce modèle à six paramètres est capable de reconstruire les articulations mesurées avec une erreur moyenne de 0,13 cm et peut également prendre en compte les différences latérales et les asymétries des contours de la langue. En vue de corriger l’hyper-articulation résultant des expositions prolongées durant l’acquisition d’IRM, les valeurs des paramètres ont été ajustées en comparant les contacts linguopalataux virtuels et ceux mesurés par électropalatographie. Des données de mouvement ont été mesurées pour des séquences voyelle-fricative à l’aide d’un articulographe électromagnétique, afin de déterminer le contrôle cinématique du modèle. De plus, un algorithme de gestion des surfaces de contact a été développé, afin d’éviter que la langue ne traverse le palais et les dents.},

La prononciation de cette consonne est en constante évolution et le dialecte souletin ne fait pas exception. Cette évolution a été étudiée suivant la variation diastratique qui nous amène à étudier les changements par le biais de facteurs sociaux.En basque et ici en souletin, il y a deux différentes vibrantes : d’un côté il y a la vibrante battue /ɾ/ et de l’autre la roulée /r/. La première vibrante ne se prononce généralement pas entre deux voyelles en souletin. La seconde en revanche se prononce dans tous les contextes.  Mais ces vibrantes connaissent à ce jour deux formes de prononciation à savoir la forme apicale (/r/) et la forme uvulaire (/ʀ/). C’est pour cela que différentes options s’offrent à chaque interlocuteur souletin. Nous verrons dans ce travail que les choix ce font par le biais des facteurs sociaux. Les jeunes ont tendance à utiliser un son plutôt qu’un autre et les plus âgés en utilisent d’autres.Les données ont été recueillies grâce à des interviews effectuées sur le terrain grâce à un questionnaire basé sur la traduction de mots. Il leur a été demandé de traduire les même mots afin d’avoir une base de donnée qui permettrait par la suite de comparer les vibrantes dans des contextes différents. Les interlocuteurs ont été choisis suivant leur âge (jeunes, adultes, personnes plus âgées), leur sexe (homme ou femme), l’origine de leur basque (si ils l’ont appris à la maison ou à l’école), la langue dans laquelle ils travaillent (en basque ou en français) et si ils ont quitté le territoire du Pays Basque plus de 4 mois ou non.Ces données ont ensuite été analysées principalement grâce à deux programmes qui sont Praat et SPSS. C’est avec ces résultats recueillis que des recherches statistiques ont été menées, et que nous avons pu en ressortir l’état actuel des vibrantes en Soule.},

As with other aspects of their grammar, the phonology of the Morehead-Maro languages differs significantly from those of other Papuan languages. The phonology of Nen is broadly similar to that of other members of the family, except that (like most other members of the Nambu branch, of which it is a member) it lacks the velar nasal phoneme found in more westerly languages, and it has a smaller fricative inventory: other languages of the family include /ɸ ɣ θ/, all absent from Nen.},

  abstract = {Sociolinguistic studies have demonstrated that centrally-connected and peripheral members of social networks can both propel and impede the spread of linguistic innovations. We use agent-based computer simulations to investigate the dynamic properties of these network roles in a large social influence network, in which diffusion is modeled as the probabilistic uptake of one of several competing variants by agents of unequal social standing. We find that highly-connected agents, structural equivalents of leaders in empirical studies, advance on-going change by spreading competing variants. Isolated agents, or loners, holding on to existing variants are safe-keepers of variants considered old or new depending on the current state of the rest of the population. Innovations spread following a variety of S-curves and stabilize as norms in the network only if two conditions are simultaneously satisfied: (1) the network comprises extremely highly connected and very isolated agents, and (2) agents are biased to pay proportionally more attention to better connected, or popular, neighbors. These findings reconcile competing models of individual network roles in the selection and propagation process of language change, and support Bloomfield’s hypothesis that the spread of linguistic innovations in heterogeneous social networks depend upon communication density and relative prestige. ß 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The language is spoken mainly in two settlements shown in Figure 1, Kejom Ketinguh [k̀ɘd͡ʒɔ́m ↓kɘ́tÍⁿɡ̀uʔ] and Kejom Keku [k̀ɘd͡ʒɔ́m ↓kɘ́k̀u], also known as Babanki Tungoh and Big Babanki, respectively, but also to some extent in diaspora communities outside of Cameroon. Simons \& Fennig (2017) state that the number of speakers is increasing; however, the figure of 39,000 speakers they provide likely overestimates the number of fluent speakers in diaspora communities. The two main settlements’ dialects exhibit slight phonetic, phonological, and lexical differences but are mutually intelligible. The variety of Kejom described here is the Kejom Ketinguh variant spoken by the second author; all data and examples which we take into account are based on his speech.},

  abstract = {The study of language evolution, and human cognitive evolution more generally, has often been ridiculed as unscientific, but in fact it differs little from many other disciplines that investigate past events, such as geology or cosmology. Well-crafted models of language evolution make numerous testable hypotheses, and if the principles of strong inference (simultaneous testing of multiple plausible hypotheses) are adopted, there is an increasing amount of relevant data allowing empirical evaluation of such models. The articles in this special issue provide a concise overview of current models of language evolution, emphasizing the testable predictions that they make, along with overviews of the many sources of data available to test them (emphasizing comparative, neural, and genetic data). The key challenge facing the study of language evolution is not a lack of data, but rather a weak commitment to hypothesistesting approaches and strong inference, exacerbated by the broad and highly interdisciplinary nature of the relevant data. This introduction offers an overview of the field, and a summary of what needed to evolve to provide our species with language-ready brains. It then briefly discusses different contemporary models of language evolution, followed by an overview of different sources of data to test these models. I conclude with my own multistage model of how different components of language could have evolved.},

  abstract = {The underlying premise of this study was that the two phonetic subsystems of a bilingual interact. The study tested the hypothesis that the vowels a bilingual produces in a second language (L2) may differ from vowels produced by monolingual native speakers of the L2 as the result of either of two mechanisms: phonetic category assimilation or phonetic category dissimilation. Earlier work revealed that native speakers of Italian identify English /ei/ tokens as instances of the Italian /e/ category even though English /ei/ is produced with more tongue movement than Italian /e/ is. Acoustic analyses in the present study examined /ei/s produced by four groups of Italian–English bilinguals who differed according to their age of arrival in Canada from Italy (early versus late) and frequency of continued Italian use (low-L1use versus high-L1-use). Early bilinguals who seldom used Italian (Early-low) were found to produce English /ei/ with significantly more movement than native English speakers. However, both groups of late bilinguals (Late-low, Latehigh) tended to produced /ei/ with less movement than NE speakers. The exaggerated movement in /ei/s produced by the Early-low group participants was attributed to the dissimilation of a phonetic category they formed for English /ei/ from Italian /e/. The undershoot of movement in /ei/s produced by late bilinguals, on the other hand, was attributed to their failure to establish a new category for English /ei/, which led to the merger of the phonetic properties of English /ei/ and Italian /e/.},

Parallels of this kind are best accounted for if both types  of phenomena are analysed within a unified framework, so similarities result from  the fact that both phonetic and phonological processes are subject to the same  constraints. A unified model of phonetics and phonology is developed and  exemplified through the analysis of parallel phonetic and phonological assimilation  processes. The model operates in terms of scalar phonetic representations to  accommodate phonetic detail, but categorical phenomena can still be derived  from the interaction of speech production constraints with constraints that  motivate the formation of distinct categories of sounds for the purposes of  linguistic contrast.},

The degree of similarity is obtained by comparing the distances between words contained within these sequences. Our results indicate that the best groupings among different species depend on the lengths of words and their respective relative frequencies. We also observed that the longer the word the more consistent the grouping between the sequences becomes. The application of our results, together with the perspective of analyzing DNA sequences belonging to a single biological species, may be important for the construction of phylogenetic trees, which are appropriate structures for understanding the evolutionary history of the species.},

  abstract = {Voiceless nasal consonants are typologically rare in the world’s languages. The present study investigates the acoustic realization of reported voiceless nasals in the Miyako Ryukyuan dialect Ikema. Voiceless nasals in Ikema occur word-initially and word-medially as part of a geminate or consonant cluster, and are phonemically distinct from modal voiced nasals. Initial observation of collected recordings revealed many instances of the voiceless phoneme with voicing throughout, leading to a re-evaluation of previous claims about its phonetic implementation. We hypothesized that word-medial and phrase-medial voiceless nasals surface as breathy voiced nasals. We analyzed the acoustic characteristics of nasal components of target words, focusing on duration, phonation state, and cepstral peak prominence (CPP), to determine whether reported voiceless nasal phonetic components with voicing are acoustically distinct from modal voiced nasal consonants. We find that voiceless nasals are produced with a voiceless component followed by a modal voiced component. Voiceless components and breathy components are found to be significantly shorter than modal components. We also find a significant difference between modal nasal, breathy nasal and voiceless nasal components’ CPP values. The results confirm the observation that Ikema voiceless nasals are phonemically distinct from modal nasal consonants, and likely allophonically vary with breathy voiced nasals word-medially and phrase-medially. These findings align with the hypothesis that voiceless nasals require some voicing to be audible for perception, and are consistent with cross-linguistic findings, contributing to the typological understanding of the acoustics of voiceless nasals.},

  abstract = {Facial and dental features are of considerable importance in biomedicine and forensics. Facial appearance has a strong genetic component and could have evolved to facilitate individual recognition. Teeth are the hardest and well-preserved parts of the body and they have been used to establish biological relatedness among past and current human populations and to identify individuals. Although genes have been identified for various facial and dental phenotypes, the genetic basis of normal variation for both traits are still poorly understood. I performed Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) using \textasciitilde 700,000 genome-wide markers from \textasciitilde 6,000 Latin American individuals (CANDELA cohort). Ordinal and quantitative facial traits were assessed in individual photographs. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) situated in four gene regions showed associations with three ordinal and quantitative traits related to nose morphology. Quantitative analyses, in addition, detected an association of SNPs in the Ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR) gene with chin protrusion. Subsequently, statistical and experimental follow-up analysis were performed to endorse the discovered significant associations. Consistently, Edar mouse mutants were characterized to observe alterations of mandible length. Subsequently, I conducted GWAS for dental traits using the same markers from a subgroup of \textasciitilde 500 volunteers from the same cohort. Eighty-six traits were scored using the Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System (ASUDAS) scale. In addition, inciso-cervical, mesiodistal and bucco-lingual distances were measured on the incisors, canines and premolars in the same photos.

This is paradoxical in view of the importance of data for phonetic research: from audio signals to the whole range of data acquired in phonetic experiments. The phonetic sciences stand to gain greatly from data availability: what is at stake is no less than reproducibility and cumulative progress. We will argue that a collective turn to Open Science holds great promise for phonetics. First, simple reflections on why access to primary data matters are recapitulated and proposed as a basis for consensus. Next, possible drawbacks of data availability are addressed. Finally, we argue that data curation and archiving are to be recognized as part of the same activity that results in the publication of research papers, rather than attempting to build a parallel system to incentivize data archiving by itself.},

  abstract = {Tongan (               lea fakatonga               , ISO 639-3 code ton) is a Polynesian language spoken mainly in Tonga, where it is one of two official languages (with English). There are about 104,000 speakers of the language in Tonga, with nearly 80,000 additional speakers elsewhere (Simons \&amp; Fennig 2017). It is most closely related to Niuean, and more distantly related to West Polynesian languages (such as Tokelauan and Samoan) and East Polynesian languages (such as Hawaiian, Māori, and Tahitian). Previous work on the phonetics and phonology of Tongan includes a general grammar (Churchward 1953), a dissertation with a grammatical overview (Taumoefolau 1998), a phonological sketch of the language (Feldman 1978), two dictionaries (Churchward 1959, Tu‘inukuafe 1992), journal and working papers on stress (Taumoefolau 2002, Garellek \&amp; White 2015), intonation (Kuo \&amp; Vicenik 2012), as well as the ‘definitive accent’ (discussed below) and the phonological status of identical vowel sequences (Poser 1985; Condax 1989; Schütz 2001; Anderson \&amp; Otsuka 2003, 2006; Garellek \&amp; White 2010; Ahn 2016; Zuraw 2018). This illustration is meant to provide an overview of the phonetic structures of the language, and includes novel acoustic data on its three-way word-initial laryngeal contrasts, which are cross-linguistically rare. The recordings accompanying this illustration come from Veiongo Hehepoto, a native speaker of Tongan currently living in Melbourne, Australia. Ms. Veiongo was born in 1950 on the island of Vava‘u (northern Tonga), but grew up and was educated in the capital city Nuku‘alofa on Tongatapu (see Figure~1). She moved to Vanuatu when she was 16 years old, and when she was 21 moved to Australia where she trained as a nurse. She continues to speak Tongan every day with family members (including children, who were born in Australia) and friends.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Speech sound appears first in the child’s speech development and is the primary means of expression. Articulation disorders can hinder the comprehensibility of children’s speech. The speech, in turn, can limit the child’s inclusion in the social and educational environment. AIM: To establish frequency and distribution of lambdacism, rhotacism and sigmatism or their combination in preschool children and the frequency and distribution of these articulation disorders among boys and girls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data from preventive examination for early diagnosis of impairments of hearing, speech and sounds in preschool children has been carried out. In the selected sample, only the data for children diagnosed with lambdacism, rhotacism, sigmatism or their combination are analysed. The data is statistically examined, represented in tables and figures and analysed descriptively. RESULTS: In the analysed sample, the greater presence of lambdacism was observed before rhotacism and sigmatism. Most commonly, these three types of articulation disorder appear alone, as isolated cases, instead of a combination of two out of the three impairments. They are more common in boys than in girls. CONCLUSION: Timely diagnosis and rehabilitation of lambdacism, rhotacism and sigmatism or their combination in preschool children will enable easier and faster integration of the children in the social and educational environment without leaving lasting consequences.},

Within these clusters, /sl/ was produced correctly most often, whereas /sn/ and / sx/ were the more difficult clusters. In cluster reductions, /s/þobstruent and /sl/ clusters reduction patterns followed the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP) by retaining the least sonorous segment; but this is not the case for the /sm/ cluster, where the more sonorous element is retained. The predictions of the factorial typology are supported. Reductions seem explainable through an interaction between sonority and the prosodic head of the cluster. Exceptions are /sn/ and /sx/, where no consistent reduction patterns are found. As expected, word production of children with phonological disorders is far less target-like than that of typically-developing children. However, the patterns of phonological simplification and reduction of the two groups are surprisingly similar. It can be concluded that language development of children with phonological disorders is delayed rather than deviant.},

An international team of experts and junior researchers present research that ranges from the low-level mechanical processes involved in speech production and perception to high-level representation and computation, based on data from across the Romance language family, including from varieties that are less widely studied.  The book is divided into five parts. In the first, chapters present acoustic studies, examining topics such as Italian anaphonesis and voiceless fricative sibilants in Galician, while chapters in part two turn to articulatory studies of features including three-consonant onsets in Romanian and rhotic variation in Tuscan Italian. The focus of the third part is perception, and includes studies of perceived phrasing in French and perceptual cues for individual voice quality, while part four examines phonological issues such as Galician mid-vowel reduction and sibilant voicing in Spanish. Chapters in the final part of the volume look at the effects of production and perception on issues in language acquisition. The book draws on a range of experimental and methodological approaches and will be of interest not only to scholars of Romance linguistics but also to all those working in phonetics and phonology from graduate level upwards.},

Being the first language of most Luxembourgers it also has the status of the national language (since 1984). Although in its origin Luxembourgish has to be considered as a Central Franconian dialect, it is nowadays regarded by the speech community as a language of its own. As a consequence, German is considered a different language. An official orthographical system has been devised. Luxembourgish is used very frequently in day-to-day oral communication at all social levels; it is very common on local radio and television; it is the only language spoken in parliament sessions and it is also very often used at the workplace. Although the vocabulary of Luxembourgish has a substantial number of loan words from French and German, the morpho-syntax follows Germanic patterns. Luxembourgish today has approximately 400,000 speakers, including many L2 speakers (around 43\% of the population does not have the Luxembourgish nationality).},

A classic source of evidence as to the units structuring speech has been patterns observed in speech errors – “slips of the tongue”. The present study reports, for the Wrst time, on kinematic data from tongue and lip movements during speech errors elicited in the laboratory using a repetition task. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that speech production results from the assembly of dynamically deWned action units – gestures – in a linguistically structured environment. The experimental results support both the presence of gestural units and the dynamical properties of these units and their coordination. This study of speech articulation shows that it is possible to develop a principled account of spoken language within a more general theory of action.},

One might predict that the phonological profile of children using a radical dialect (e.g., Puerto Rican Spanish, which alters consonants in the syllable rhyme) will differ from that of children who use a conservative dialect (e.g., Mexican Spanish, which preserves such consonants). This study evaluated the impact of such dialectal differences by comparing the phonological skills of two groups of Spanish-speaking children with phonological disorders. Six participants used the Mexican dialect; the other six used the Puerto Rican dialect of North American Spanish. All children were matched on number of segmental errors and age, which ranged from 4;4 to 5;6 (M54;10). A single-word assessment instrument was used to elicit data, and independent and relational analyses were completed for each child. Measures included phonetic inventory complexity, vowel accuracy, consonant accuracy, sound class accuracy, percentage-of-occurrence of phonological patterns, and frequency and types of substitutions. Significant between-group differences were not found for any measures. These findings do not support the hypothesis of significant phonological differences between phonologically disordered speakers of radical and conservative Spanish dialects.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the nature of substitution errors in typically developing Spanish-speaking children and those with phonological disorders. Previous research with Englishspeaking children has indicated that the frequency and types of substitution errors are two types of information that speech-language pathologists can use to differentially diagnose phonological disorders. In addition, previous studies with Italian speakers [Bortolini, U., \& Leonard, L. (1991). The speech of phonologically disordered children acquiring Italian. Clinical Linguisitcs \& Phonetics, 5, 1 – 12.] and Portuguese speakers [Yavas¸, M., \& Lamprecht, R. (1988). Processes and intelligibility in disordered phonology. Clinical Linguistics and Phonetics, 2, 329 – 345.] have indicated that substitution errors differ based on ambient language. No study has examined this phenomenon in Spanishspeaking children. In the current study, frequency and types of substitution errors in 39 typically developing children were compared to those in 39 age-matched children with phonological disorders. For both singletons and consonant clusters, typically developing children utilized a smaller number of substitutes per target, used a single substitute for a smaller number of targets, and exhibited dissimilar substitution patterns compared to their peers with phonological disorders. Some specific substitutions types were different than those reported for English-speaking children, indicating a language-specific pattern. These results have implications for the identification of Spanish-speaking children with phonological disorders and the cross-linguistic and language-specific nature of substitution errors.},

  abstract = {It is perfectly reasonable for laypeople and non-linguistic scholars to use names for languages without reflecting on the proper definition of the objects referred to by these names. Simply using a name like English or Witotoan suffices as an informal communicative designation for a particular language or a language group. However, for the linguistics community, which is by definition occupied with the details of languages and language variation, it is somewhat bizarre that there does not exist a proper technical apparatus to talk about intricate differences in opinion about the precise sense of a name like English or Witotoan when used in academic discussion. We propose three interrelated concepts—LANGUOID, DOCULECT, and GLOSSONYM—which provide a principled basis for discussion of different points of view about key issues, such as whether two varieties should be associated with the same language, and allow for a precise description of what exactly is being claimed by the use of a given genealogical or areal group name. The framework they provide should be especially useful to researchers who work on underdescribed languages where basic issues of classification remain unresolved.},

Our main hypothesis was that children with FAD would show co-existing auditory speech processing disorders, with different levels of these skills depending on the nature of the receptive processes. The tasks included (i) sentence and non-word repetitions, (ii) non-word discrimination and (iii) sentence and story comprehension. Results suggest that the auditory speech processing of children with FAD is underdeveloped compared with that of typically developing children, and largely varies across task types. In addition, there are differences between children with FAD and controls in all age groups from 5 to 8 years. Our results have several clinical implications.},

Finally I touch on the syntactic and semantic issues that most directly affect the design of a lexical database of the language. These include discussion of verbal diathesis and the nature of complex multi-word verbal idioms. The thesis is a lexicographic study because the aim is to present information sufficient for a reasonable understanding of the lexical entries of the language, as represented in the included dictionary.},

The contribution of this paper is a robust phoneme recognition to control the feedback provided to the patient during a speech therapy session. We compare the results of hierarchical and flat classification, with naive Bayes, support vector machines and kernel density estimation on linear predictive coding coefficients and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients.},

Drawing on data from the most recent fieldwork-based studies, which have appeared since the past two decades, the chapter offers a typologically and (when possible) historically informed presentation of their main linguistic features and of their most interesting characteristics. All the major levels of linguistic structure are presented, including phonetics and phonology, the word classes and their morphology, noun phrases, verbal and non-verbal predicates, main and dependent clauses and discourse.},

Situated in the extreme south, close to the Belgian border, the city is fairly small, with a population of just over 120,000. Maastricht enjoys a world-wide reputation as the place where the Maastricht Treaty was signed in 1992. The dialect of Maastricht belongs to the south-eastern dialect group (Weijnen 1966: §§ 166, 173), which shares a number of properties with dialects in Belgium and Germany. A more recent classification (Belemans, Kruijsen \& van Keymeulen 1998) assigns the dialect to Central Limburgian, which comprises seven subgroups in the Netherlands and Belgium, more particularly to Trichterlands. Two earlier descriptions are Houben (1905), which is historically oriented, and van Buuren (1991).},

  abstract = {Zwara Berber is a variety of Nafusi (ISO 639-3; Lewis, Simons \& Fennig 2016) which belongs to the eastern Zenati group within northern Berber (where Berber is the scientific term for Tamazight), a branch of Afro-Asiatic. Zwara (Zuwārah, Zuwara, Zuāra, Zuara, Zouara) is a coastal city located at 32.9° N, 12.1° E in Libya. The speakers refer to themselves as /               a               t               ˈ               w               i               l               .               l               u               l               / (also /               a               j               t               ˈ               w               i               l               .               l               u               l               /) ‘those of Willul’ and to their specific variety of the language as /               t               .ˈ               w               i               l               .               l               u               l               t               / ‘the language of Willul’. Having no official status during the Italian colonization of Libya and the first period after the country's independence in 1951, repression of the language became severe after the Cultural Revolution of 1973. Its propagation through teaching and the media fell under a constitutional ban on the denial of the Arab identity of the state, and qualified as such as treason, a capital offense. Until the revolution of 2011 (‘17 February’), the language was therefore not spoken in cultural, educational or governmental domains and could not be taught, printed or broadcast. The number of Tamazight speakers in Libya is estimated at 184,000 in Lewis et al. (2016) and at 560,000 by Chakel \& Ferkal (2012). In the absence of a municipal register, the number of inhabitants in Zwara is uncertain. A conservative estimate is between 50,000 and 100,000, which is also the number of speakers of the Zwara variety. Other than through exposure by radio and television, children learn Arabic only from age six, when attending school. Speakers have variable L2 Arabic competence depending on exposure to the language.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Soft palate plays a significant role in various important functions in the head and neck region. Its varied morphology is implicated in variety of diseases. Therefore, it is essential to establish the morphology of soft palate in normal patients to establish the variations in its morphology in various diseases. The present study aims to investigate the variation of the soft palate morphology in Indian subpopulation and possibly classify types of soft palate, to evaluate the dimensional differences of the soft palate between each types and to investigate the proportional differences in different age and gender groups. Materials and methods: Two hundred digital lateral cephalograms were analyzed for the velar morphology and categorized into different types. In addition length and thickness of the soft palate was also measured. Results: In addition to original seven types of soft palate two more morphological variants of soft palate were observed. The velar length was significantly higher in males and the velar width was significantly less in females. Also a significant increase in velar length was observed with increase in age. Conclusion: Type 1 was the most common of all the variants. Moreover, additional morphological variants which did not fit into the classical categories were also observed. There was no significant correlation between the different age groups and the types of soft palate. The velar length and width was significantly greater in males than in females. A significant increase in velar length was noted with increase in age.},

The child originally presented a complex of speech disorders and was treated by a speech–language pathologist using phonological process techniques. The procedures successfully corrected most of his speech problems, although /r/ remained severely distorted. The primary acoustic manifestation of this distortion was a high third formant. Surgical correction of a banded lingual frenulum, along with adenotonsillectomy indicated for sleep apnea, is shown to have had a small eVect in lowering the third formant. A dramatic change was seen on reintroduction of therapy, when an extreme drop in third formant frequencies for /r/ was observed. The acoustic data are interpreted using speaker-internal controls derived from a dialect-appropriate adult model.},

We demonstrate that the avoidance of such sequences does not always follow from more general co-occurrence constraints banning sequences of any sonorant consonant (or liquid) plus any glide. The avoidance of /rj/ etc. will also be argued not to be a consequence of sonority sequencing or any other abstract phonological entities (such as distinctive features). Instead, we claim that the tendency in many languages to avoid /rj/ etc. requires specific constraints (e.g. *rj), which are grounded in articulatory phonetics.},

A total of 30 patients with a history of snoring were investigated for the presence or absence of three vocal symptoms immediately after they awoke from sleep: hoarseness, voice weakness, and other changes in voice quality. All patients were also asked to complete a voice-related quality-of-life (V-RQOL) questionnaire. Findings were compared with those of an age- and sex-matched control group of 30 nonsnorers. The most common vocal symptom in the snoring group was hoarseness, which occurred in 11 patients (36.7\%); voice weakness and other voice quality changes were present in 8 snorers each (26.7\%). In the control group, the most common vocal symptom was voice weakness, which was present in 7 subjects (23.3\%); 5 controls (16.7\%) experienced other changes in voice quality, and 3 controls (10.0\%) experienced hoarseness. The difference between the prevalence of hoarseness in the two groups was statistically significant (p = 0.030), and the differences in voice weakness and other voice quality changes were not. The mean V-RQOL score was 87.50 ± 26.89 in the snoring group and 96.00 ± 5.82 in the control group—again, not a statistically significant difference. Finally, we found no association between any of the three vocal symptoms and the prevalence of mouth breathing, the level of snoring loudness, and the mean number of snores per minute. We conclude that snorers are more likely to experience hoarseness than are nonsnorers.},

Word embeddings show promise as a diachronic tool, but have not been carefully evaluated. We develop a robust methodology for quantifying semantic change by evaluating word embeddings (PPMI, SVD, word2vec) against known historical changes. We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity—the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation—independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.},

We make the case for systematically studying the correspondences between the structures of human spatial language and the spatially structured practices of human groups within specific landscapes, and for considering this relation within a diachronic framework, as a process of cultural and linguistic adaptation to the physical environment. The last section presents the research design of the Nahuatl Space Project, which investigates the possibility of environmental adaptation of spatial language in four varieties of the Nahuan languages of Mexico.},

  abstract = {Eastern Andalusian Spanish (henceforth EAS), is spoken in the east of Andalusia, the southernmost autonomous region of Spain. EAS is most similar to Western Andalusian Spanish (WAS) and to Murcian Spanish, the latter spoken in the autonomous region of Murcia, immediately to the east of Andalusia, and it shares some phonetic traits with EAS, such as vowel lowering. Geographically, Eastern Andalusia includes the provinces of Almería, Granada, Jaén and Málaga, although the precise linguistic delimitation of this area is somewhat more complicated (Figure~1). The main criterion to differentiate EAS from WAS is the lowering or opening of vowels preceding underlying /s/ (Villena Ponsoda 2000). More detailed information on the differences between EAS and WAS can be found in Jiménez Fernández (1999), Villena Ponsoda (2000), Moya Corral (2010) and Valeš (2014). According to Alvar, Llorente \& Salvador (1973: map 1696), Cádiz and Huelva in the west are the only Andalusian provinces where vowel lowering before underlying /s/ is not found. As the geographical extent of this phenomenon is widely debated, it is difficult to calculate the precise number of speakers of EAS, but we can assert that this geolect is the native variety of Spanish of approximately 2,800,000 speakers if we take into account the figures from the last census of Andalusia in 2011 (Instituto de Estadística y Cartografía de Andalucía 2011).},

  abstract = {Jamaican Creole is one of the major Atlantic English-lexifier creoles spoken in the Caribbean. In Jamaica, this creole is popularly labelled as ‘Patwa’ (Devonish \& Harry 2004: 441). There is a widely-held view in Jamaica that a post-creole continuum exists. The continuum is between Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole (Meade 2001: 19). Many scholars holding this view find it necessary to distinguish among acrolectal, mesolectal and basilectal varieties (Irvine 1994, Beckford-Wassink 1999, Patrick 1999, Meade 2001, among others). Major phonological differences are found between the two extremes. However, a discussion of the phonological differences in the continuum and problems with the theoretical notion of a ‘post-creole continuum’ is beyond the scope of this paper. The aim of this paper is to provide an adequate description of some salient aspects of the synchronic phonetics and phonology of Jamaican Creole based on the speech forms of two native Jamaican Creole speakers, Stacy-Ann Watt, a post-graduate female student at the University of West Indies, Mona, and Racquel Sims, 22 year old female from the parish of St Catherine. Both come from the Eastern parishes of the island.},

Although the contributions do not agree on the existence of asymmetries or on the explanations for observed asymmetries, they all address the relation between children’s production of a particular linguistic form and their comprehension of this form. As this Special Issue shows, the relation between children’s performance in language production, their performance in language comprehension, and their knowledge of grammar may not be as straightforward as has often been assumed. ß 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This paper reports on an acoustic analysis of the phonemic tap-trill contrast (/ɾ/-/r/) for first and second generation speakers of Mexican Spanish who live in the Chicagoland area. First, it is shown that speakers most commonly produce phonemic trills with a single apical occlusion, although there is much individual variation. Second, nearly all speakers realize the tap-trill contrast by means of segmental duration, and this is especially true for speakers who favor zero or one closures in the phonemic trill. These data suggest that heritage speakers make use of the limits of phonetic variation to the extent that phonological contrasts are intact in their grammar. The findings have implications for disentangling the sources of individual variation in heritage pronunciation. Specifically, we propose that between-speaker instabilities in rhotic production result more directly from an inherently variable speech signal than from the language contact situation.},

The acoustic analysis revealed a considerable number of non-canonical variants containing one or zero apical occlusions. The quantitative results showed robust effects of the following three factors on trill articulation: Speaker dialect, gender, and preceding vowel. Regarding social factors, central Peninsular speakers and male speakers showed the greatest propensity to produce fewer occlusions per phonemic trill. Regarding linguistic factors, non-canonical variants were especially common in contexts of preceding /u/; we interpret this result on articulatory grounds given the antagonistic gestures required for the trill and the high back vowel. All in all, these findings offer empirical support that geographically-oriented studies within a sociophonetic framework offer critical information on the diachrony of trill consonants.},

The description of American English provided by Ladefoged was based on a southern California dialect. The purpose of this report is to augment that account with a brief description of southern Michigan speech patterns. According to Labov and colleagues (e.g. Labov, Yeager \& Steiner 1972, Labov 1994), southern Michigan, particularly in its urban areas, is part of a relatively large dialect region in the inland northeast United States called ‘Northern Cities’. According to Labov, the Northern Cities dialect cuts an irregular swath through a chain of cities in the inland northeast extending, roughly, from upstate New York (e.g. Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo), through northern Ohio (e.g. Cleveland, Toledo), southern Michigan (e.g. Detroit, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids), northwest Indiana (e.g. Gary, Hammond), northeast Illinois (e.g. Chicago, Rockford) and south-central Wisconsin (e.g. Milwaukee, Madison). Speakers from neighboring regions such as northwest Vermont, northwest Pennsylvania, and north-central/northeast Indiana appear to show some features of the dialect. Labov contends that the vowel shifts that characterize the Northern Cities dialect are observed in their most advanced forms in the largest urban areas of the region, such as Detroit, Buffalo, and Rochester.},

Dahl (1951) presents widely-accepted evidence that Malagasy is most closely related to the Indonesian language Ma’anyan of Kalimantan (South Borneo). The term Malagasy refers to a macrolanguage (Lewis, Simons \& Fennig 2014), with many regional dialects distributed throughout the island of Madagascar, which lies off the east African coast across from Mozambique (see Figure 1) and has a population of over 22 million (INSTAT 2018). The central area of the country, or the ‘Central Highlands’, is a plateau of up to 5000 feet and includes the capital city of Antananarivo, with a metropolitan population of about four million. The dialect historically spoken in and around Antananarivo is called Merina, and it served as the primary basis for development of the standardized, institutional language referred to as               Malagasy Ofisialy               ‘Official Malagasy’ (OM).},

  abstract = {Czech has a sibilant inventory that contrasts at three places of articulation: Alveolar, a prepost-alveolar, and palato-alveolar. The specific aim of this study is to examine the perception of the typologically rare Czech sibilant inventory and to determine whether acoustic-perceptual characteristics play a role in the maintenance of the Czech trillfricative. These results are compared to a more common three-way sibilant inventory, Polish. Native Czech listeners performed an auditory AX discrimination task in two blocks: A Czech block and a Polish block. Stimuli were embedded in varying levels of noise to increase task difficulty. Signal-to-noise ratio differences affected the perception of the Czech sibilants more than Polish sibilants. Moreover, a multidimensional scaling analysis revealed less perceptual dispersion for the Czech inventory than the Polish inventory. These results suggest that there is greater difficulty maintaining the Czech inventory considering the signal-to-noise comparisons and that this a factor that contributes to its rarity; however, similarities in perceptual dispersion indicate that maintenance across several acoustic-perceptual cues is possible, and Czech shows few signs of losing this typologically rare contrast.},

  abstract = {Finding phonetic correlates of rhotics as a natural class has been elusive, leading to the suggestion that any classbased relationship between different rhotic categories is purely phonological in nature. This paper examines native English speakers’ perception of three different non-native rhotics (i.e., /r ɻ ʀ/) compared to non-native sounds from four other manners of articulation (stops, nasals, fricatives, and laterals). The results revealed that speakers cannot reliably discriminate between the rhotics examined here and that the perceptual distance between members of the class of rhotics is smaller than the other tested classes, aside from the comparison with laterals. The current results suggest that there is an acoustic-perceptual correlate to rhotics as a natural class and that their perception explains the relative rarity of large rhotic inventories cross-linguistically. The comparison with laterals also suggests why rhotics are often paired with laterals in inventories with two or more liquids.},

  abstract = {Two of the major problems with rhotics are: (1) rhotics, unlike most other classes, are highly resistant to secondary palatalization, and (2) acoustic cues for rhotics as a class have been elusive. This study examines the acoustics of Upper and Lower Sorbian rhotics. Dynamic measures of the F1-F3 and F2-F1 were recorded and compared using SSANOVAs. The results indicate there is a striking delay in achievement of F2 for both the palatalized rhotics, while F2, F1, and F2-F1 are similar for all the rhotics tested here. The results suggest an inherent articulatory conflict between rhotics and secondary palatalization. The delay in the F2 increase indicates a delay in the palatalization gesture. This is likely due to conflicting constraints on the tongue dorsum. There was also an overlap in the F2 and F2-F1 for both the uvular and alveolar rhotics. This suggests a strong acoustic cue to rhotic classhood is found in the F2 signal. The overall formant similarities in frequency and trajectory also suggest a strong similarity in the vocal tract shapes between uvular and alveolar rhotics.},

  abstract = {Background: Concerted evolution is normally used to describe parallel changes at different sites in a genome, but it is also observed in languages where a specific phoneme changes to the same other phoneme in many words in the lexicon—a phenomenon known as regular sound change. We develop a general statistical model that can detect concerted changes in aligned sequence data and apply it to study regular sound changes in the Turkic language family. Results: Linguistic evolution, unlike the genetic substitutional process, is dominated by events of concerted evolutionary change. Our model identified more than 70 historical events of regular sound change that occurred throughout the evolution of the Turkic language family, while simultaneously inferring a dated phylogenetic tree. Including regular sound changes yielded an approximately 4-fold improvement in the characterization of linguistic change over a simpler model of sporadic change, improved phylogenetic inference, and returned more reliable and plausible dates for events on the phylogenies. The historical timings of the concerted changes closely follow a Poisson process model, and the sound transition networks derived from our model mirror linguistic expectations. Conclusions: We demonstrate that a model with no prior knowledge of complex concerted or regular changes can nevertheless infer the historical timings and genealogical placements of events of concerted change from the signals left in contemporary data. Our model can be applied wherever discrete elements—such as genes, words, cultural trends, technologies, or morphological traits—can change in parallel within an organism or other evolving group.},

A continuous trickle of immigration of Jews originating in Spain continued after that date, as some of those who had gone to exile in other Mediterranean and Western European countries eventually also decided to resettle in Ottoman cities. Some Spanish-speaking families continued to migrate from the cities of the Italian peninsula to Istanbul and other centers of the Ottoman empire up until the eighteenth century. Another stream included Hispano-Portuguese families, Jews who had resettled in Portugal after the expulsion but were forced to undergo conversion there in 1497, and after a period of clandestine Jewish existence started emigrating to other countries in the sixteenth century. First Bayonne in France, then Amsterdam and other Hanseatic cities became important centers for Hispano-Portuguese families that returned to Judaism, and these maintained relations with, and occasionally sent immigrants to, the Jewish communities of the Ottoman cities.},

This paper presents a classification approach for automatically recognizing and analyzing tongue shapes based on geometric features. The approach corrects the tongue deflection by applying three geometric criteria and then classifies tongue shapes according to seven geometric features defined using various measurements of length, area and angle of the tongue. To establish a measurable and machine readable relationship between expert human judgments and the machine classifications of tongue shapes, we use a decision support tool, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), to weight the relative influences of the various length/area/angle factors used in classifying a tongue, and then apply a fuzzy fusion framework that combines seven AHP modules, one for each tongue shape, to represent the uncertainty and imprecision between these quantitative features and tongue shape classes. Experimental results show that the proposed shape correction method reduces the deflection of tongue shapes and that our shape classification approach, tested on a total of 362 tongue samples, achieved an accuracy of 90.3\%, making it more accurate than either KNN or LDA.},

A recent linguistic study concluded that a similar decay in phoneme inventories in human languages was also the product of the SFE process. However, the SFE process makes additional predictions for patterns of neutral genetic diversity, both within and between groups, that have not yet been tested on phonemic data. In this study, we describe these predictions and test them on linguistic and genetic samples. The linguistic sample consists of 725 widespread languages, which together contain 908 distinct phonemes. The genetic sample consists of 614 autosomal microsatellite loci in 100 widespread populations. All aspects of the genetic pattern are consistent with the predictions of SFE. In contrast, most of the predictions of SFE are violated for the phonemic data. We show that phoneme inventories provide information about recent contacts between languages. However, because phonemes change rapidly, they cannot provide information about more ancient evolutionary processes.},

The vibration (simple or multiple) and the articulatory effort involved in the preceding consonant (velar and bilabial) as well as in the position of the vibrants within the word (cluster or intervocalic) were the most influential linguistic factors in the achievement of the Spanish articulation. Two other significant variables were found: Level of classes abroad and effect of instruction for those in the on-campus pronunciation course. The results point out the specific linguistic aspects and styles that should be emphasized in classroom practices. They also suggest that pronunciation instruction/acquisition on the vibrants is more effective after the intermediate level.},

  abstract = {Standard Tajik, or Modern Literary Tajik as it was called during the Soviet era, was established in the nineteen twenties and thirties based largely on the dialects of the Bukhara-Samarkand area, which was at the time the undisputed cultural centre of the Tajik-speaking population. Dushanbe, the current capital of Tajikistan, was then a small village with a population of only a few hundred and had no cultural heritage comparable to that of Bukhara or Samarkand. Bukharan Tajik, whose phonology is described in this paper, is a variety of Tajik that played a particularly influential role in the phonological standardization of Tajik, which took place for the most part in 1930. For instance, the Scientific Conference of Uzbekistan Tajiks of 1930 resolved that the dialect of Bukhara must be the designated basis of the sound and orthography of literary Tajik (вaroji tajjorī вa kanfiransijaji ilmiji istalinoвod 1930: 2). In August the same year, the Linguistic Conference held in the then newly established Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic also adopted a similar resolution that establishes the ‘language of the Tajiks of Samarkand and Bukhara’ as the reference point in establishing the literary (i.e. standard) pronunciation (Halimov 1974: 126). According to Bergne (2007: 82), ‘the same Linguistic Conference of 22 August 1930 in Stalinabad decided that the phonetic base for the language had better be the dialect of Bukhara’. Thus, the Bukharan Tajik of today is the direct descendant of the variety of Tajik which served as a primary basis of standard Tajik phonological norms; and hence differs little from standard Tajik phonologically and phonetically.},

A native speaker audio-recorded and transcribed single-word responses to a picture-naming task (110 words) that included eight words with WI rhotic clusters and two with WI singleton /r/. Accuracy was significantly higher in the TD groups and for the PPD groups, by age. Mismatch patterns varied: the PPD cohort had the most varied patterns although the younger children with PPD showed more /r/ deletion in clusters, and the TD groups and 5-year-olds with PPD more substitutions for /r/. Substitutions for rhotics included taps (most frequent; possibly an acceptable variant), voiced uvular and palatal fricatives, laterals, glides, other rhotics, stops and nasals. These results add to the growing database on Bulgarian phonological acquisition concerning accuracy and mismatches by group and age.},

  abstract = {The convexity of the dorsal surface of the velum is critical for normal velopharyngeal (VP) function and is largely attributed to the levator veli palatini (LVP) and musculus uvulae (MU). Studies have correlated a concave or flat nasal velar surface to symptoms of VP dysfunction including hypernasality and nasal air emission. In the context of surgical repair of cleft palates, the MU has been given relatively little attention in the literature compared with the larger LVP. A greater understanding of the mechanics of the MU will provide insight into understanding the influence of a dysmorphic MU, as seen in cleft palate, as it relates to VP function. The purpose of this study was to quantify the contributions of the MU to VP closure in a computational model. We created a novel 3D finite element model of the VP mechanism from MRI data collected from an individual with healthy non-cleft VP anatomy. The model components included the velum, posterior pharyngeal wall (PPW), LVP, and MU. Simulations were based on the muscle and soft tissue mechanical properties from the literature. We found that, similar to previous hypotheses, the MU acts as i) a space-occupying structure and ii) a velar extensor. As a space-occupying structure, the MU helps to nearly triple the midline VP contact length. As a velar extensor, the MU acting alone without the LVP decreases the VP distance 62\%. Furthermore, activation of the MU decreases the LVP activation required for closure almost three-fold, from 20\% (without MU) to 8\% (with MU). Our study suggests that any possible salvaging and anatomical reconstruction of viable MU tissue in a cleft patient may improve VP closure due to its mechanical function. In the absence or dysfunction of MU tissue, implantation of autologous or engineered tissues at the velar midline, as a possible substitute for the MU, may produce a geometric convexity more favorable to VP closure. In the future, more complex models will provide further insight into optimal surgical reconstruction of the VP musculature in normal and cleft palate populations.},

  abstract = {In the world's languages there is a close relationship among three lingual segment types: taps/flaps such as (c), trills such as (r), and stops such as (d). These segment types are phonetically similar, all involving contact between the tongue tip/blade and the region on/near the alveolar ridge. This dissertation is a typological survey of the phonetic and phonological relationships among these sounds using data from about 65 languages from a broad range of language families, including original phonetic data from about 15 languages. Several case studies are presented which demonstrate that intervocalic tapping of stops is widespread crosslinguistically. Phonetic data show that intervocalic tapping of trills is also widespread. These processes are analyzed as lenition in the temporal and spatial domains. A representation depicting this lenition process as the spreading of aperture is proposed. It is also shown that not all trills and taps that contrast in a language can be represented as a geminate/singleton pair, so an additional feature is needed to represent this contrast. Incorporating the generalization about the phonetic relationship between trills and taps, a phonetic length feature is proposed. In addition, the allophonic interaction between stops and trills in examined, revealing that in most cases an intermediate step of tap can be found. In three cases, the trill/stop alternation is phonologized to the extent that the intermediate tap is no longer evident. Also several languages with prestopped trills are examined, leading to the conclusion that they are trills that begin at the closure phase of the vibratory cycle and need no special representation.},

  abstract = {The article examines the sociolinguistic variations of the alveolar tap [ɾ] in Dagbani female names, a Gur language spoken in the northern part of Ghana. It focuses on how the language is losing the pronunciation of the alveolar lateral /l/ in some female names through sound substitution. The sound [ɾ] does not occur in word-initial position in Dagbani, but it is currently prominent in the pronunciation of some Dagbani female names. The article shows that the pronunciation of the alveolar tap [ɾ] in Dagbani speech communities provides the complexity of linguistic variation and language change. It also reveals that while the alveolar lateral /l/ variety is the prestigious form in Dagbani, the alveolar tap [ɾ] variety is spreading due to the Arabic education in the area. The article supports the Labovian paradigm and presents quantitative analysis of the data. The article suggests that the alveolar tap [ɾ] is frequent in the speech of the younger generation, while the alveolar lateral /l/ is frequent in the speech of the older generation.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis of the phonological patterns of two varieties of Brythonic Celtic in the framework of substance-free phonology. I argue that cross-linguistic variation in sound patterns does not derive solely from differences in grammars (implemented as Optimality Theoretic constraint rankings). Instead, I adopt the substance-free framework, based on the principle of modularity and autonomy of the phonological component, to account for cross-linguistic phonological and phonetic variation. Phonological representations in substance-free phonology are built up without regard to the physical implementation of phonological units, on the basis of the system of contrasts and patterns of alternation. Although this insight is not new when couched in terms of a language-specific assignment of a set of universal phonological features, I argue that the mapping between phonology and phonetics is also not universal and deterministic, and reject the universality of the feature set. Instead, I argue for a rich interface between phonology and phonetics.    Based on this understanding of the nature of variation, I provide a holistic analysis of the sound systems of two closely related languages: Pembrokeshire Welsh and Bothoa Breton. I propose an account in terms of a rich representational theory. Among other proposals, I defend the need for surface ternary contrasts, which I propose to implement using feature geometry. I also show that the substance-free approach, which decouples phonological representation from phonetic realization, strikes the correct balance between innatist and emergentist approaches to phonological markedness; I demonstrate this by way of an extensive case study of laryngeal phonology, which leads to a reinterpetation of the approach known as 'laryngeal realism'. I also argue that the phonological component of grammar should allow constraints with prima facie undesirable factorial consequences, if such constraints are needed to account for functionally unmotivated sound patterns, and discuss the consequences of this approach for the substance-free nature of phonological computation.},

  abstract = {Russian maintains a contrast between non-palatalized and palatalized trills that has been lost in most Slavic languages. This research investigates the phonetic expression of this contrast in an attempt to understand how the contrast is maintained. One hypothesis is that the contrast is stabilized through resistance to coarticulation between the trill and surrounding vowels and prosodic positional weakening effects—factors expected to weaken the contrast. In order to test this hypothesis, we investigate intrasegmental and intersegmental coarticulation and the effect of domain boundaries on Russian trills. Since trills are highly demanding articulatorily and aerodynamically, and since Russian trills are in contrast, there is an expectation that they will be highly resistant to coarticulation and to prosodic influence. This study shows, however, that phonetic variability due to domain boundaries and coarticulation is systematically present in Russian trills. Implications of the relation between prosodic position and lingual coarticulation for the Degree of Articulatory Constraint (DAC) model, Articulatory Phonology, and the literature on prosodic strength are discussed. Based on the quantitative analysis of phonetic variability in Russian trills, we conjecture a hypothesis on why the contrast in trills is maintained in Russian, but lost in other Slavic languages. Specifically, phonological strategies used by several Slavic languages to deal with the instability of Proto-Slavic palatalized trills are present phonetically in Russian. These phonetic tendencies structure the variability of Russian trills, and could be the source of contrast stabilization.},

The focus is on the deformation of the whole midsagittal edge of the tongue in transitions between lingual segments, rather than the movement of individual points of the tongue, which is the traditional focus of tongue dynamics research. Based on the analysis of 600 lingual transitions from an X-ray database of speech, it is shown that there are only two basic patterns of tongue movement, the pivot and the arch, which are independent of the starting and ending segments of a transition. It is then argued that the acoustic effect of these patterns of tongue deformation is to make the acoustic signal as articulatorily-transparent as possible.},

We introduce here a realistic computer model of the vocal tract, constructed from actual human MRI data, which can learn, using machine learning techniques, to control the articulators in such a way as to produce speech sounds matching as closely as possible to a given set of target vowels. We systematically control the vertical position of the larynx and we quantify the differences between the target and produced vowels for each such position across multiple replications. We report that, indeed, larynx height does affect the accuracy of reproducing the target vowels and the distinctness of the produced vowel system, that there is a “sweet spot” of larynx positions that are optimal for vowel production, but that nevertheless, even extreme larynx positions do not result in a collapsed or heavily distorted vowel space that would make speech unintelligible. Together with other lines of evidence, our results support the view that the vowel space of human languages is influenced by our larynx position, but that other positions of the larynx may also be fully compatible with speech.},

The phonetic realisation of /r/ was analysed for middle-class speakers of the towns of Kinross and Dundee, in both prevocalic and non-prevocalic positions. It appears that the phonological environment has a decisive role in the distribution of the major variants, which are the alveolar tap and the postalveolar or retroflex approximant, as well as the vocalisation of /r/ in non-prevocalic position. The results indicate a change from the tap towards the approximant in Kinross, while Dundee remains more linguistically conservative.},

Not only do they tend to be acquired at the last stages of the acquisition period, but also their distribution is usually constrained (cf. Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996, Żygis 2005). As a consequence of being complex, rhotics manifest a strong susceptibility to phonetic change. The present paper reports the results of an experiment that aimed at describing various physical realisations of the Polish phoneme /r/ placed in intervocalic position. The data presented in the article show that in this position speakers do not articulate a tap, but in most cases they produce either a fricative or an approximant. In the light of the data, high vowels constitute an environment that is more conducive to this sort of reduction than mid or low vowels.},

  abstract = {This cephalometric study investigated morphological changes occurring in the pharynx between early and middle adult life. A sample of 16 young adults (mean age 20.2 years) had cephalometric films taken and repeated after an interval of 32 years. Changes in pharyngeal skeletal size, pharyngeal soft tissue thickness, pharyngeal airway depth, and soft palate dimensions were examined, in addition to standard craniofacial measurements. The results showed increases in maxillary prominence, and upper and lower anterior face height. The nasopharyngeal skeletal dimensions were unchanged over the 32-year interval, while the anteroposterior depth of the nasopharyngeal lumen increased as a result of a reduction in thickness of the posterior nasopharyngeal wall. In the oropharynx, the depth of the airway decreased with age, and the soft palate became longer and thicker.},

The current study investigates to what extent /r/ is a marker of a bilingual’s dominant language. To this end, a reading task was carried out by bilingual speakers from South Tyrol, who produce /r/ differently according to whether they dominantly speak Tyrolean or Italian. The recorded reading data were subsequently used in a perception experiment to investigate whether South Tyrolean bilingual listeners are able to identify the dominant language of the speaker. Results indicate that listeners use /r/ as a cue to determine the dominant language of the speaker whilst relying on articulatory distinctions between the variants. It is furthermore shown that /r/ correlates with three interdependent variables: the sociolinguistic background of the speakers, their speech production, and how their speech is perceived.},

Francoprovençal enjoys varying levels of official status across these regions. In France, for example, Francoprovençal was only recognised by the Ministry for Culture and Communication in 1999 as a ‘language of France’, but it does not constitute one of the handful of regional languages protected by law that are permitted in the education system. Conversely, in the Aosta Valley (Italy), which enjoys an autonomous status, Francoprovençal is protected under Federal law, and is taught in schools (see Josserand 2003).},

Two aspects of Spanish tap production were examined: lingual constriction rates and the degree of lingual constriction. Multiple measures associated with Spanish proficiency, use, and input were reduced to a smaller number of dimensions using principal component analysis, and the effects of the components on heritage speakers’ tap production were analyzed using mixed effects modeling. The overall findings suggest that dominance in Spanish may not have an effect on the degree of lingual constriction of heritage speakers’ taps, but it does have an effect on how frequently heritage speakers produce taps with lingual constriction. Spanish use and input were found to be the main contributors to heritage speakers’ target-like production of taps.},

Scholars such as Tabard (1838) maintained a relation to Chinese, while Maspero (1912), despite noting similarities to Mon-Khmer, argued for an affiliation with Tai. However, at least since the work of Haudricourt (1953), most scholars now agree that Vietnamese and related Vietic languages belong to the Mon-Khmer branch of the Austroasiatic family.},

It is attained by several underlying principles that are universal to both biological organisms and sophisticated engineering systems. Robustness facilitates evolvability and robust traits are often selected by evolution. Such a mutually beneficial process is made possible by specific architectural features observed in robust systems. But there are trade-offs between robustness, fragility, performance and resource demands, which explain system behaviour, including the patterns of failure. Insights into inherent properties of robust systems will provide us with a better understanding of complex diseases and a guiding principle for therapy design.},

Participants rated /r/ sounds as fully correct, distorted or incorrect/non-rhotic. Second and third formant heights were measured to explore the relationship between acoustic cues and perceptual judgments. Inexperienced listeners' agreement was greater for correct productions than for distorted or incorrect/non-rhotic productions. In addition, inexperienced listeners' differentiation of intermediate versus fully incorrect /r/ had lower sensitivity and specificity relative to an acoustically defined threshold than experienced listeners' classification. These findings are consistent with results of previous studies highlighting the difficulty in identifying gradations of correctness in misarticulated /r/, and they suggest that this ability may be influenced by clinical experience. Additionally, all listeners were noted to be more consistent in rating vocalic /r/ than consonantal /r/. Implications for clinician training and treatment planning are discussed.},

  abstract = {Successful speech perception requires that listeners map the acoustic signal to linguistic categories. These mappings are not only probabilistic, but change depending on the situation. For example, one talker’s /p/ might be physically indistinguishable from another talker’s /b/ (cf. lack of invariance). We characterize the computational problem posed by such a subjectively nonstationary world and propose that the speech perception system overcomes this challenge by (1) recognizing previously encountered situations, (2) generalizing to other situations based on previous similar experience, and (3) adapting to novel situations. We formalize this proposal in the ideal adapter framework: (1) to (3) can be understood as inference under uncertainty about the appropriate generative model for the current talker, thereby facilitating robust speech perception despite the lack of invariance. We focus on two critical aspects of the ideal adapter. First, in situations that clearly deviate from previous experience, listeners need to adapt. We develop a distributional (belief-updating) learning model of incremental adaptation. The model provides a good fit against known and novel phonetic adaptation data, including perceptual recalibration and selective adaptation. Second, robust speech recognition requires listeners learn to represent the structured component of cross-situation variability in the speech signal. We discuss how these two aspects of the ideal adapter provide a unifying explanation for adaptation, talker-specificity, and generalization across talkers and groups of talkers (e.g., accents and dialects). The ideal adapter provides a guiding framework for future investigations into speech perception and adaptation, and more broadly language comprehension.},

  abstract = {Kalasha (ISO 639-3: kls), also known as Kalashamon, is a Northwestern Indo-Aryan language spoken in Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkwa Province in northern Pakistan, primarily in the valleys of Bumburet, Rumbur, Urtsun, and Birir, as shown in Figure~1. The number of speakers is estimated between 3000 and 5000. The               Ethnologue               classifies the language status as ‘vigorous’ (Eberhard, Simons \& Fennig 2019) but some researchers consider it ‘threatened’ (Rahman 2006, Khan \& Mela-Athanasopoulou 2011). Kalasha has been in close contact with Nuristani and other Northwestern Indo-Aryan languages. Among the latter, the influence of Khowar has been particularly strong because it functions as a               lingua franca               of Chitral District (Liljegren \& Khan 2017). The Kalasha lexicon includes many loanwords from Khowar, as well as from Persian, Arabic, and Urdu (Trail \& Cooper 1999). Early efforts to put the language in writing employed Arabic script but a Latin-based script was adopted in 2000 (Cooper 2005, Kalash \& Heegård 2016).},

Anomaly detection spans a wide range of applications, from detecting terrorist cells in counter-terrorism efforts to identifying unexpected mutations during ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcription. Fittingly, numerous algorithmic techniques for anomaly detection have been introduced. However, to date, little work has been done to evaluate these algorithms from a statistical perspective. This work is aimed at addressing this gap in the literature by carrying out statistical evaluation of a suite of popular spectral methods for anomaly detection in networks. Our investigation on statistical properties of these algorithms reveals several important and critical shortcomings that we make methodological improvements to address. Further, we carry out a performance evaluation of these algorithms using simulated networks and extend the methods from binary to count networks.},

The present study provides a comprehensive documentation of the historical phonology of one Northwestern language, Monsang. The unexpected finding is that Monsang cannot be considered conservative in its phonological development. A large number of sound changes have occurred across all phonological domains. The majority of sound changes are mergers, and with small exceptions, no unusual sound changes are found. As a result, the diachronic development of Monsang can be considered a case of reduction in phonological complexity.},

We then examine how commenters respond to the enactment. Specifically, we apply Irvine and Gal's notion of semiotic differentiation to study how participants use language to construct and apply polycentric notions of modernity/nonmodernity. This allows us to analyze how YouTube performers and commenters produce their own and Antonio's relative (non)modernity, as they orient to different versions of a modern/nonmodern axis of differentiation, situated in multiple ‘centers’: France, Portugal, or Europe. That is, participants either interpret Antonio as a nonmodern immigrant in France, a nonmodern emigrant from Portugal, or an international representative of Portugal, spreading nonmodern images of Portugal abroad. We then consider how participants bring these differently centered images of the nonmodern Other into dialogue with each Other, with different outcomes for variously positioned participants.

Unlike genetic factors, nutritional causes can be corrected and may therefore contribute to the prevention of OFC. The goal of this review is to summarize the embryogenesis and genes involved in OFC, and to give an overview of the nutrients and related genes in humans. Improving our knowledge of the role of nutrition, genes, and their interactions in the pathogenesis of OFC may stimulate the development of nutritional interventions for OFC prevention in the future.},

  abstract = {This is a comprehensive account of the phonetic and phonological properties of Norwegian. The author considers the structure of the lexicon and the principles by which the ordering of sounds in Norwegian can be defined. He then discusses word phonology and its interaction with lexicalstructure; the principles of syllabification; the placement of stress; the tonal accents characteristic of most dialects; intonation; and connected speech. Dr Kristoffersen concludes with an analysis of the complex relations between written and spoken language in Norway.A the end of the fourteenth century, Norway, having previously been an independent kingdom, became by conquest a province of Denmark and remained so for three centuries. In1814, as part of the fall-out from the Napoleonic wars, the country became a largely independent nation within the monarchy ofSweden. By this time, however, Danish had become the language of government, commerce, and education, as well as of the middle and upper classes. Nationalistic Norwegians sought to re-establish native identity by creating and promulgating a new language based partly on rural dialects and partly onOld Norse. The upper and middle classes sought to retain a form of Norwegian close to Danish that would be intelligible to themselves and to their neighbours in Sweden and Denmark. The controversy has gone on ever since. One result is that the standard dictionaries of Norwegian ignore pronunciation,for no version can be counted as 'received'. Another is that there has been considerable variety and change in Norwegian over the last 180 years, all of which is well documented. In this pioneering account of Norwegian phonology, Gjert Kristoffersen mines the evidence to present an original analysisof the ways in which the sounds and meanings of competing languages change and evolve.The book is written within the framework of generative phonology, making use of insights derived from Optimality Theory. Its main, and successful, purpose is to present the phonological system of Norwegian clearly and concisely.},

However, little is known about effects of phonetic context on acoustical properties of word-medial obstruents in true voice languages. The present study investigates changes in duration of glottal pulses in Russian word-medial obstruents. The data come from 14 Russian speakers, who pronounced phrases with 2165 voiced and voiceless obstruents before segments with low and high sonority in the slow and fast speaking rate conditions. The findings provide empirical evidence that duration of glottal pulsing in voiced obstruents increases in response to sonority of adjacent segment and at slow speaking rate. The findings reveal that the maximum increase (57 ms) was found in prevocalic position at slow rate, suggesting sonority and speaking rate may feed one another to enhance glottal pulsing in voiced obstruents.},

We report this rare case of congenital absence of uvula in a patient with no other known abnormalities.},

  abstract = {This study reports on a longitudinal study of ten children’s consonant productions. Data were analysed to determine the word initial, word medial, and word final consonant inventories of these children at 4-, 15- and 25-word points, as well as the rank order of consonant phonemes. Comparisons were made to Finnish-speaking 2-year-old children and adult speakers. Analysis of the phonetic inventories of the children indicated that the size of early inventories were somewhat smaller than those reported for children acquiring English. The types of consonant phones used in early words were in line with previous findings, as consisting primarily of stops and nasals. Finally, the results indicated a closeness to the adult language in terms of the frequent use of phonemes that carry a high functional load in the language. Thus, both universal and language specific features seem to have a role to play during the early acquisition of consonants.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is to understand how /r/ emerged and developed in Proto-Japanese and how the conditions of its emergence shed light on its present phonological behavior. The paper first offers a review of the phonetic, phonological, and morpho-phonological characteristics of /r/ in Japanese through examination of a large array of empirical evidence. The picture that emerges is that of an unmarked, phonologically empty segment, confirming a number of previous studies, in particular that by Mester and Itoˆ (Language 65:258–293, 1989). I argue that /r/ primarily developed in Japanese as a default epenthetic consonant in the intervocalic position within the morphological domain of a stem and its affixes, through an ‘emergence of the unmarked’ mechanism before becoming a fully contrastive phoneme later on by virtue of a phonologization process. A formal account of this proposal within the framework of Optimality Theory is offered. It is shown that the phonological content of /r/ is acquired due to the application of well-formedness constraints (ONSET, ALIGN, MAXIO, DEPIO) as well as that of two sets of markedness constraints (FEATURAL AGREEMENT and HARMONY SCALE), which ensure that the null input is mapped to the least marked output in terms of phonological features.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of word-initial rhotic avoidance (WIRA) from a~typological point of view. Its first aim is to document WIRA cross-linguistically, based~on the examination of a sample of 200 languages designed by the WALS (Dryer and~Haspelmath 2013). This set of 200 languages has been surveyed in order to reveal~rhotic (and more generally liquid) phonotactic patterns in relation to word-initial~avoidance. On the basis of this survey, the paper identifies two types of WIRA: i)~phonological, or emic-WIRA; and ii) phonetic, or etic-WIRA. The first and most notable~result of this research is that 49\% of all languages containing at least one phonemic~rhotic exhibit some degree of emic-WIRA, i.e, they possess no word or very few words~beginning phonologically with at least one of their rhotics in their native lexicon. The~paper also examines how word-initial rhotics are adapted from a non-WIRA language~into a WIRA language. The loanword adaptation data suggest that WIRA is a recessive~feature because no language in the sample has been observed to develop WIRA due~to language contact (although one exception, Gascon, has been identified outside of~the 200-language sample). Finally, the paper proposes two new universals in relation~to WIRA: 1) if a language forbids /l/ word-initially, it also forbids /r/; 2) a rhotic segment~never occurs as the positional allophone of a non-liquid segment word-initially.},

We compare large-scale quantitative studies with more traditional theoretical and historical linguistic research and identify divergent assumptions and methods that have led linguists to be skeptical of correlational work. We also attempt to demystify statistical techniques and point out the importance of informed critiques of the validity of statistical approaches. Finally, we describe various methods used in recent correlational studies to deal with the fact that, because of contact and historical relatedness, individual languages in a sample rarely represent independent data points, and we show how these methods may allow us to explore linguistic prehistory to a greater time depth than is possible with orthodox comparative reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Strong similarities observed between babbling and first words suggest a universal foundation of word production in children. The aim of this work was to evaluate the role of biomechanical constraints on babbling and first words production in two children acquiring Tashlhiyt, a Berber language spoken in Morocco. When considering isolated sounds and syllable types, our data provided evidence for a universal basis for early vocal patterns. The subjects produced more stops, more coronals and labials, vowels preferentially belonging to the lower left part of the vowel space, and open syllables. However, they only partially confirmed the existence of the preferred CV combinations generally observed in the early production of children learning various languages. The comparison between babbling and first words revealed a linguistic continuity between the two periods but also some increasing complexity and diversification in the words, which can be explained by an increase of articulatory capacities.},

It builds on conventional evolutionary theory by placing emphasis on the capacity of organisms to modify sources of natural selection in their environment (niche construction) and by broadening the evolutionary dynamic to incorporate ontogenetic and cultural processes. In this model, phenotypes have a much more active role in evolution than generally conceived. This sheds light on hominid evolution, on the evolution of culture, and on altruism and cooperation. Culture amplifies the capacity of human beings to modify sources of natural selection in their environments to the point where that capacity raises some new questions about the processes of human adaptation.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is a reference grammar of the Malimiut Coastal dialect of Inupiaq (ISO: ESI, ESK, IPK), an Eskimo-Aleut language of northwestern Alaska spoken by the Inupiat people. It complements existing descriptions of Inupiaq by filling gaps in documentation. With approximately 2000 speakers, mainly above 50 years of age, Inupiaq is endangered. Within the Inupiat community, there is a strong commitment to language documentation and revitalization. The current work aims to provide a comprehensive description of Inupiaq morphosyntax to the Inupiat and academic communities. This dissertation uses the standard Inupiaq writing system and IPA for all examples in the hope that by including both scripts, the work will be maximally useful to the Inupiat community, scholars, and other interested parties. After introducing the language and reviewing previous work, the dissertation describes Malimiut Inupiaq phonetics and phonology, nominal and verbal morphology, syntactic categories, wordhood, constituency, and other syntactic topics. A final chapter draws comparisons between Inupiaq and other Eskimo-Aleut languages/dialects and summarizes major findings. These include a previously undocumented phonological change in progress, the shift of /z/ (Inupiaq 'r') to American English /r/ in younger speakers and heritage learners. Several interrelated variables are involved, including age, Inupiaq literacy, and the influence of English. The dissertation also documents case stacking, such that demonstrsatives can take grammatical case twice, previously undocumented in Eskimo-Aleut. The discovery of case stacking on adverbs (non-arguments) is particularly exciting, challenging current theories that motivate case stacking via argument structure. Although eastern Inuit dialects have been extensively documented, many areas of Inupiaq grammar remain undocumented. This dissertation is the first to discuss a number of morphosyntactic topics specifically for Inupiaq, including argument status, clause-level and sentence-level constituency, types of predication, wordhood (phonological vs. morphological vs. syntactic), and clause combining. A real need to separate morphology and syntax in Inupiaq becomes evident. It is often assumed that because Inuit languages are predominantly suffixing languages---there is virtually no other morphological process-morphology and syntax are one and the same in these languages. However, clause combining and constituency---among other phenomena---demonstrate that purely syntactic phenomena exist in the language.},

To date, most sociophonetic work on consonants has made use of acoustic analysis to reveal unexpectedly subtle variation which is nonetheless socially indexical (e.g. Docherty and Foulkes 1999). However, some aspects of speech production are not readily recoverable even with a fine-grained acoustic analysis. New articulatory analysis techniques, such as ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI), allow researchers to push the boundaries further, identifying seemingly covert aspects of speech articulation which pattern with indexical factors with remarkable consistency. One such case is postvocalic /r/ variation in Central Scotland.},

According to historical surveys, this is particularly true for the most southwestern fringe of the region, i.e. German-speaking Switzerland. Large-scale, multilocality studies that show an updated picture of regional variation in this region are lacking, however. To this end, we coded /r/s of almost 3,000 speakers from 438 localities on a predominantly auditory basis, using data crowdsourced through a smartphone app. We report substantial regional variation, with uvular articulations especially dominant in the Northwest and the Northeast and alveolar – particularly tapped – articulations prevalent in the Midlands. We further provide exemplary evidence of an urban ([ʁ]) vs. rural stratification ([ɾ]) in the Northwest.

  abstract = {English is an official language in the Philippines, along with Filipino, a standardized register originally based on Tagalog (Gonzalez 1998). The Philippines were a Spanish colony for over three centuries, but when the Americans took control in 1898, they immediately implemented English instruction in schools (Gonzalez 2004). It became much more widespread among Filipinos than Spanish ever was, and by the late 1960s, Philippine English was recognized as a distinct, nativized variety (Llamzon 1969). It is widely spoken throughout the country as a second language, alongside Filipino and approximately 180 other languages (Lewis, Simmons \& Fennig 2016). It is also spoken in the home by a small number of Filipinos, especially among the upper class in Metro Manila (Gonzalez 1983, 1989) and other urban areas. There is a large body of literature on Philippine English. However, relatively few studies have focused on its sound system. The most detailed phonological descriptions of this variety have been by Tayao (2004, 2008), although there have also been previous sketches (Llamzon 1969, 1997; Gonzalez 1984). There has been very little phonetic research on Philippine English, apart from some work describing the vowel system (Pillai, Manueli \& Dumanig 2010, Cruz 2015).},

This approach makes it possible to introduce new criteria for language classification, which would be difficult or impossible to achieve with the traditional, type-based approach. This point is illustrated by several quantitative studies of word order variation, which can be measured as entropy at different levels of granularity. I argue that this variation can be explained by general functional mechanisms and pressures, which manifest themselves in language use, such as optimization of processing (including avoidance of ambiguity) and grammaticalization of predictable units occurring in chunks. The case studies are based on multilingual corpora, which have been parsed using the Universal Dependencies annotation scheme.},

  abstract = {Human sounds can be roughly divided into two categories: speech and non-speech. Traditional audio scene analysis research puts more emphasis on the classification of audio signals into human speech, music, and environmental sounds. We take a different perspective in this paper. We are mainly interested in the analysis of non-speech human sounds, including laugh, scream, sneeze, and snore. Toward this goal, we investigate many commonly used acoustic features and select useful ones for classification using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and support vector machine (SVM). To evaluate the robustness of the selected features, we also perform extensive simulations to observe the effect of noise on the accuracy of the classification. Finally, for the class of snoring sounds, we propose a robust approach to further categorize them into simple snores and snores of subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).},

  abstract = {In human society, the facial surface is visible and recognizable based on the facial shape variation which represents a set of highly polygenic and correlated complex traits. Understanding the genetic basis underlying facial shape traits has important implications in population genetics, developmental biology, and forensic science. A number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with human facial shape variation, mostly in European populations. To bridge the gap between European and Asian populations in term of the genetic basis of facial shape variation, we examined the effect of these SNPs in a European–Asian admixed Eurasian population which included a total of 612 individuals. The coordinates of 17 facial landmarks were derived from high resolution 3dMD facial images, and 136 Euclidean distances between all pairs of landmarks were quantitatively derived. DNA samples were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array and imputed using the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Genetic association between 125 previously reported facial shape-associated SNPs and 136 facial shape phenotypes was tested using linear regression. As a result, a total of eight SNPs from different loci demonstrated significant association with one or more facial shape traits after adjusting for multiple testing (significance threshold p\,{$<$}\,1.28\,×\,10−3), together explaining up to 6.47\% of sex-, age-, and BMI-adjusted facial phenotype variance. These included EDAR rs3827760, LYPLAL1 rs5781117, PRDM16 rs4648379, PAX3 rs7559271, DKK1 rs1194708, TNFSF12 rs80067372, CACNA2D3 rs56063440, and SUPT3H rs227833. Notably, the EDAR rs3827760 and LYPLAL1 rs5781117 SNPs displayed significant association with eight and seven facial phenotypes, respectively (2.39\,×\,10−5\,{$<$}\,p\,{$<$}\,1.28\,×\,10−3). The majority of these SNPs showed a distinct allele frequency between European and East Asian reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project. These results showed the details of above eight genes influence facial shape variation in a Eurasian population.},

The majority of the speakers are found in Chitral (a district and erstwhile princely state bordering Afghanistan, see Figure 1), where the language is used as a lingua franca, but there are also important pockets of speaker groups in adjacent areas of Gilgit-Baltistan and Swat District as well as a considerable number of recent migrants to larger cities such as Peshawar and Rawalpindi (Decker 1992: 25–26). Its closest linguistic relative is Kalasha, a much smaller language spoken in a few villages in southern Chitral (Morgenstierne 1961: 138; Strand 1973: 302, 2001: 252). While Khowar has preserved a number of features (phonological, morphological as well as lexical) now lost in other Indo-Aryan languages of the surrounding Hindukush-Karakoram mountain region, it has, over time, incorporated a massive amount of lexical material from neighbouring or influential Iranian languages (Morgenstierne 1936) – and with it, new phonological distinctions. Certain features might also be attributable to formerly dominant languages (e.g. Turkic), or to linguistic substrates, either in the form of, or related to, the language isolate Burushaski, or other, now extinct, languages previously spoken in the area (Morgenstierne 1932: 48, 1947: 6; Bashir 2007: 208–214). There is relatively little dialectal variation among the speakers in Chitral itself, probably attributable to the relative recency of the present expansion of the language (Morgenstierne 1932: 50).},

  abstract = {The magnitude of anterior and dorsal constrictions for laterals in /(C)(C)VlC/ words produced by eight American English speakers was measured using ultrasound imaging. The results replicate previous findings that laterals have weaker anterior constrictions when followed by labial or velar consonants than when followed by alveolar consonants. The main novel finding is that, in words with /VlClabial/ or /VlC{$\mkern1mu$}velar{$\mkern1mu$}/ sequences, this anterior constriction was weaker in high-frequency words (help, milk) than in low-frequency words (whelp, ilk). Although high-frequency words also showed slight reduction of the dorsal constriction, dorsal reduction was stable, small in magnitude, and not correlated with anterior reduction, consistent with alveolar reduction not being simply a consequence of overall weaker lingual constrictions in more frequent words. Acoustic measures for laterals showed that the degree of anterior constriction correlated with the frequency separation between F1 and F2: more reduced alveolar constrictions – especially likely in high-frequency words – were linked with greater formant proximity. These articulatory and acoustic patterns are interpreted as potentially contributing to the initiation and lexical diffusion of historical /l/ lenition. It is proposed that gestural reduction in high-frequency words in which the anterior gesture for laterals must be coordinated with another supralaryngeal constriction serves as a precipitating factor in /l/ vocalization and possibly (although to a lesser extent) /l/ loss.},

  abstract = {Orofacial clefting is the most common congenital craniofacial malformation, appearing in approximately 1 in 700 live births. Orofacial clefting includes several distinct anatomic malformations affecting the upper lip and hard and soft palate. The etiology of orofacial clefting is multifactorial, including genetic or environmental factors or their combination. A large body of work has focused on the molecular etiology of cleft lip and clefts of the hard palate, but study of the underlying etiology of soft palate clefts is an emerging field. Recent advances in the understanding of soft palate development suggest that it may be regulated by distinct pathways from those implicated in hard palate development. Soft palate clefting leads to muscle misorientation and oropharyngeal deficiency and adversely affects speech, swallowing, breathing, and hearing. Hence, there is an important need to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of soft palate development. Significantly, the anatomy, function, and development of soft palatal muscles are similar in humans and mice, rendering the mouse an excellent model for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms of soft palate clefts. Cranial neural crest–derived cells provide important regulatory cues to guide myogenic progenitors to differentiate into muscles in the soft palate. Signals from the palatal epithelium also play key roles via tissue-tissue interactions mediated by Tgf-β, Wnt, Fgf, and Hh signaling molecules. Additionally, mutations in transcription factors, such as Dlx5, Tbx1, and Tbx22, have been associated with soft palate clefting in humans and mice, suggesting that they play important regulatory roles during soft palate development. Finally, we highlight the importance of distinguishing specific types of soft palate defects in patients and developing relevant animal models for each of these types to improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of soft palate development. This knowledge will provide a foundation for improving treatment for patients in the future.},

At the same time, the demand for cross-linguistic datasets has been increasing, as witnessed by numerous studies devoted to diverse questions on human prehistory, cultural evolution, and human cognition. Unfortunately, most published datasets lack standardization which makes their comparison difficult. Here, we present a new approach to increase the comparability of cross-linguistic lexical data. We have designed workflows for the computer-assisted lifting of datasets to Cross-Linguistic Data Formats, a collection of standards that make these datasets more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). We test the Lexibank workflow on 100 lexical datasets from which we derive an aggregated database of wordlists in unified phonetic transcriptions covering more than 2000 language varieties. We illustrate the benefits of our approach by showing how phonological and lexical features can be automatically inferred, complementing and expanding existing cross-linguistic datasets.},

It is spoken in the urban areas of the Tianjin Municipality (CN-12) in the People's Republic of China, which is about 120 kilometers to the southeast of Beijing. Existing studies on Tianjin Mandarin have focused mainly on its tonal aspects, especially its intriguing tone sandhi system, with few studies examining the segmental aspects (on tone, see e.g. Li \& Liu 1985, Shi 1986, Liu 1993, Lu 1997, Wang \& Jiang 1997, Chen 2000, Liu \& Gao 2003, Ma 2005, Ma \& Jia 2006, Zhang \& Liu 2011, Li \& Chen 2016; on segmental aspects, see e.g. Han 1993a, b; Wee, Yan \& Chen 2005). As also noted in Wee et al. (2005), this is probably due to the similarity in segmental structures between Tianjin Mandarin and Standard Chinese, especially among speakers of the younger generation, and what differentiates the two Mandarin varieties is most notably their tonal systems. The aim of the present description is therefore to provide a systematic phonetic description of both segmental and tonal aspects of Tianjin Mandarin, with main focus on the tonal aspects.},

  abstract = {/R/ sounds display much variation in many of the world’s languages, being vulnerable to changes in their pronunciation. This unstable type of sound is found in French. Many linguists have studied the /R/ sound variation of different dialects around the Francophone world, such as French-speaking Africa or Canadian French. However, the variation found within France has not been thoroughly investigated. I initiated this research with the aim to further our understanding of the linguistic evolution of speakers living in France. This project seeks to prove that differences in /R/ pronunciation can be attributed to various social factors, such as gender, age, and contact with other languages, as well as linguistic factors such as stress and surrounding sounds. This study analyzes the speech of Paris-native speakers or those who have lived in the city for an extended period of time. For this purpose, I recorded these speakers performing three tasks: reading a list of words, which they had to put into sentences; a picture description; and an informal interview. After having analyzed most of the data, I have found that the speakers who have contact with other languages (specifically African creoles) show cases of pronouncing the /R/ similar to a vowel and have cases of trills (the Old French pronunciation), which are not found in the other speakers. In addition, the younger speakers show signs of exposure to a more recent phenomenon: a weakening of the sound. These results suggest that the behavior of French speakers in France is different from other dialects since they display an evolution in their language in which the French /R/ is shifting to a completely different sound. These findings shed light on the origin of language changes in Standard French, Paris, and help us predict when French speakers can expect an upcoming linguistic phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Rhotic consonants are subject to much variation in their production cross-linguistically. The Romance languages provide an excellent example of rhotic variation not only across but also within languages. This study explores rhotic production in French based on acoustic analysis and considerations of different conditioning factors for such variation. Focusing on trills, previous cross-linguistic studies have shown that these rhotic sounds are oftentimes weakened to fricative or approximant realizations. Furthermore, their voicing can also be subject to variation from voiced to voiceless. In line with these observations, descriptions of French show that its uvular rhotic, traditionally a uvular trill, can display all of these realizations across the different dialects. Focusing on Metropolitan French, i.e., the dialect spoken in Paris, Webb (2009) states that approximant realizations are preferred in coda, intervocalic and word-initial positions after resyllabification; fricatives are more common word-initially and in complex onsets; and voiceless realizations are favored before and after voiceless consonants, with voiced productions preferred elsewhere. However, Webb acknowledges that the precise realizations are subject to much variation and the previous observations are not always followed.},

Singapore is home to various cultures and languages, and local speech norms are needed to provide an accurate reference for assessing phonological disorders in the local population. This study aims to establish normative data and better understand the English phonological development of English–Mandarin bilingual preschoolers in Singapore, aged 3; 6–4; 5 years. The Articulation and Phonology subtests of the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology –UK were used to collect speech data from 146 preschoolers. Responses were scored against two standards – British Standard English (BSE) and Singapore English (SGE), in terms of speech sound accuracy, and the frequency and type of error patterns present. The effect of language dominance on the children’s English phonological abilities was explored. Results showed that the preschoolers’ speech sound accuracy increased significantly when scored against SGE versus BSE targets. The number of children identified to be using several error patterns was reduced when SGE targets were used instead of BSE targets. English-dominant children scored significantly higher than their Mandarin-dominant peers on measures of speech sound accuracy. The identification of error patterns also differed between the two groups. These results show that it is important to take dialectal variation and language dominance into account in assessment, to determine if speech characteristics are due to a speech sound disorder or just normal dialectal variations.},

Objetivo: investigar se as variáveis linguísticas e a variável extralinguística sexo interferem na aquisição do /R/ em Santa Maria e em Crissiumal. Métodos: A pesquisa contou com 914 itens lexicais de 136 sujeitos, entre 1:6 e 4:2, com desenvolvimento fonológico típico, monolíngues, falantes do Português Brasileiro. Foi investigado o papel das variáveis linguísticas tonicidade, número de sílabas, contexto fonológico precedente e seguinte e posição na palavra, e da variável extralinguística sexo na aquisição do /R/ em onset simples. A análise estatística foi realizada por meio do Pacote Computacional VARBRUL. Resultados: A partir da análise estatística dos dados coletados, em Santa Maria, as variáveis linguísticas contexto seguinte e número de sílabas, e a variável extralinguística sexo foram estatisticamente significantes na produção do /R/. Em Crissiumal, além do contexto seguinte, a variável tonicidade foi considerada significante estatisticamente. Conclusão: Apesar de a variável contexto seguinte ter sido significante nos dois municípios, com base nos resultados obtidos, verificou-se que a maioria das variáveis linguísticas e extralinguística consideradas interferem de forma distinta na aquisição do r-forte quando este é produzido como fricativa velar/glotal (em Santa Maria) ou vibrante simples e múltipla (em Crissiumal).},

  abstract = {Background: Languages differ greatly both in their syntactic and morphological systems and in the social environments in which they exist. We challenge the view that language grammars are unrelated to social environments in which they are learned and used. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a statistical analysis of .2,000 languages using a combination of demographic sources and the World Atlas of Language Structures— a database of structural language properties. We found strong relationships between linguistic factors related to morphological complexity, and demographic/socio-historical factors such as the number of language users, geographic spread, and degree of language contact. The analyses suggest that languages spoken by large groups have simpler inflectional morphology than languages spoken by smaller groups as measured on a variety of factors such as case systems and complexity of conjugations. Additionally, languages spoken by large groups are much more likely to use lexical strategies in place of inflectional morphology to encode evidentiality, negation, aspect, and possession. Our findings indicate that just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. As adults learn a language, features that are difficult for them to acquire, are less likely to be passed on to subsequent learners. Languages used for communication in large groups that include adult learners appear to have been subjected to such selection. Conversely, the morphological complexity common to languages used in small groups increases redundancy which may facilitate language learning by infants. Conclusions/Significance: We hypothesize that language structures are subjected to different evolutionary pressures in different social environments. Just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and used. The proposed Linguistic Niche Hypothesis has implications for answering the broad question of why languages differ in the way they do and makes empirical predictions regarding language acquisition capacities of children versus adults.},

As it is desirable to label and segment a phonetic corpus uniformly and also to facilitate a high degree of inter-labeller agreement, rules for specifying speechsound boundaries should be unambiguous and as straightforward as possible. In this study, we examined various acoustic forms of Czech /r/ – from the trill and a flap to strongly reduced instances – and their implications for segmentation. The above-mentioned requirements resulted in the necessity to treat the segmentation of intervocalic items of /r/ differently from items occurring in consonant clusters.},

Consequently, a secure understanding of a variable's distribution can hold a key to understanding the forces that have causally shaped it. A storied distribution in linguistics has been Zipf's law, a kind of power law. In the wake of a major debate in the sciences around power-law hypotheses and the unreliability of earlier methods of evaluating them, here we re-evaluate the distributions claimed to characterize phoneme frequencies. We infer the fit of power laws and three alternative distributions to 168 Australian languages, using a maximum likelihood framework. We find evidence supporting earlier results, but also qualifying and nuancing them. Most notably, phonemic inventories appear to have a Zipfian-like frequency structure among their most-frequent members (though perhaps also a lognormal structure) but a geometric (or exponential) structure among the least-frequent. We highlight implications for causal accounts.},

  abstract = {Phoneticians typically distinguish three principal sub-disciplines within phonetics: these are concerned with how speech is produced, the nature of the sound itself, and how a human being reacts to speech stimuli. These first two areas are commonly referred to as articulatory (or physiological) phonetics and acoustic phonetics. The third encompasses auditory and perceptual phonetics; that is, it concerns both the way that the human auditory system works and the effects of various levels of further processing in the brain, in which a speaker's linguistic knowledge and experience play an important role. It is frequently difficult to separate auditory and perceptual effects since their investigation commonly relies on overt responses collected from listeners in which the sum of both kinds of processes is necessarily reflected.A phonetic research project, whether in the field or in the laboratory, may be directed at investigating articulatory, acoustic, or auditory/perceptual facts alone. However, many studies consider the relationship between articulatory or auditory/perceptual facts and the acoustic layer which mediates between them. A naïve native speaker's sub-conscious phonetic knowledge about his or her language concerns only production and perception, and not acoustic properties, nor the strictly auditory processes which transform the acoustic signal. However, the articulatory organization of speech must succeed in encoding information in acoustic form, and the perceptual apparatus must succeed in extracting the information from the acoustic signal. Because a good deal is known about articulatory/acoustic relationships, an examination of acoustic patterns can provide indirect information on articulation.},

The results obtained were subjected to statistical analysis to find out the association between variants of the soft palate with gender and different age groups. Results: The most frequent type of soft palate was Rat tail shaped. (46.25\%) followed by Leaf shape, 18.75\% Butt shape, 13.33\% and Handle shape, 10\%. S-shape7.5\% and Crook shape, was 4.1\%. There was no significant difference between Males and Females. Conclusions: The knowledge of a varied spectrum of velar morphology and the variants of the soft palate assist in the better understanding of the velopharyngeal closure and craniofacial anomalies.},

  abstract = {The variety described here is representative of colloquial Assamese spoken in the eastern districts of Assam. Assam is a North-Eastern state of India, therefore Assamese and creoles of Assamese like Nagamese are spoken in the different North-Eastern states of Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and also the neighbouring country of Bhutan. Approximately 15 million people speak Assamese in India (see               Ethnologue               , Gordon 2005, which lists 15,374,000 speakers including those in Bhutan and Bangladesh). In the pre-British era (until 1826), the kingdom of Assam was ruled by Ahom kings and the then capital was based in the Eastern district of Sibsagar and later in Jorhat. American missionaries established the first printing press in Sibsagar and in the year 1846 published a monthly periodical               Arunodoi               using the variety spoken in and around Sibsagar as the point of departure. This is the immediate reason which led to the acceptance of the formal variety spoken in eastern Assam (which roughly comprises of all the districts of Upper Assam). Having said that, the language spoken in these regions of Assam also show a certain degree of variation from the written form of the ‘standard’ language. As against the relative homogeneity of the variety spoken in eastern Assam, variation is considerable in certain other districts which would constitute the western part of Assam, comprising of the district of Kamrup up to Goalpara and Dhubri (see also Kakati 1962 and Grierson 1968). In contemporary Assam, for the purposes of mass media and communication, a certain neutral blend of eastern Assamese, without too many distinctive eastern features, like /ɹ/ deletion, which is a robust phenomenon in the eastern varieties, is still considered to be the norm. The lexis of Assamese is mainly Indo-Aryan, but it also has a sizeable amount of lexical items related to Bodo among other Tibeto-Burman languages (Kakati 1962), and there are a substantial number of items borrowed from Hindi, English and Bengali in recent times.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This paper describes typical speech development of Setswana. Although there is information on Setswana phonology, very little is known about the acquisition of segmental phonology in this language. Method: An assessment tool was devised to collect speech samples from 36 first language Setswana-speaking children aged 3.0–6.0 years in the North-West Province of South Africa. This study describes the acquisition of consonants, vowels, syllable structures and phonological processes at various ages. Result: Findings indicate a relatively early acquisition of consonants, although trill /r/ continues to develop after 6.0 years, particularly in the penultimate syllable. Phonological features such as rounding develop in the later pre-school years. Findings also suggest that girls may achieve accuracy before boys. The older group of children presented with fewer phonological processes. Processes found in the speech of younger children included deletion of syllables, gliding, assimilation and simplifying complex words. Conclusion: These findings are discussed in relation to normative data from other languages, in particular to those belonging to the same language group. Knowledge of Setswana development will help Speech-Language Pathologists working with Setswana-speaking children to identify and manage phonological difficulties in this population. The results contribute to an increasing body of locally relevant information on typical phonological development.},

There are currently only four fluent speakers of Ja’a Kumiai (Miller 2016b). Recordings were made over a six-month period with a 48-year-old female speaker born and raised in Juntas de Nejí. Quantitative data reported in this paper are taken from a subset of the current corpus, from recordings made with the speaker in a soundproof booth.

  abstract = {Standardized assessments of children’s isiXhosa phonology have not yet been developed and there is limited information about developmental norms in this language. This article reports on the phonological development of 24 typically developing first language isiXhosa-speaking children aged 3;0–6;0 years, in Cape Town, South Africa. The order and age of acquisition of isiXhosa phonemes, emergence and elimination of phonological processes and percentage consonants and vowels correct are described. A set of culturally and linguistically appropriate pictures was used to elicit single word responses that were recorded and transcribed. The study found that children had acquired most isiXhosa phonemes by 3;0 years although aspirated plosives, affricates, fricatives and clicks were still developing. In particular, the affricates and aspirated plosives were still developing in the 5-year-old children in this sample, suggesting that these may be the latest acquired segments. Children were able to produce basic word shapes by 3;0 years, but some of the words of 4–6 syllables were still being mastered by the 4- and 5-year-old children. Phonological processes that have been well documented for other languages were used by children in this sample (e.g. deaffrication, stopping and gliding of liquids). Findings presented for this pre-school-aged sample are related to theories of phonological acquisition to provide normative data on phonological development in isiXhosa-speaking children.},

The variety described in this paper is spoken by approximately 12,000 people in                     Ecuador. The Salasaca ‘parroquia’ (Spanish usage in                     Ecuador of this word is for a non-religious administrative district), in Pelileo                     canton, in Tungurahua province, is divided into eighteen communities and Quichua                     is spoken in all of them. This variety is similar to that of others of the                     region and is included in the Stark \& Muysken (1977) dictionary.                     Varieties of Quechua in this area do not have the more open allophones attested                     farther south (such as in Peru), and for that reason the Ecuadorian varieties                     are traditionally called ‘Quichua’ rather than                     ‘Quechua’.},

  abstract = {Purpose: A developmental hierarchy of phonetic feature complexity has been proposed, suggesting that later emerging sounds have greater articulatory complexity than those learned earlier. The aim of this research was to explore this hierarchy in a relatively unexplored language, Icelandic. Method: Twenty-eight typically-developing Icelandic-speaking children were tested at 2;4 and 3;4 years. Word-initial and word-medial phonemic inventories and a phonemic implicational hierarchy are described. Result: The frequency of occurrence of Icelandic consonants in the speech of 2;4 and 3;4 year old children was, from most to least frequent /n, s, t, p, r, m, l, k, f, ʋ, j, ɵ, h, kʰ, c, ð̨, ɰ, pʰ, tʰ, cʰ, ç, r,̥ n̥, l/̥ . Conclusion: Consonant frequency was a strong predictor of consonant accuracy at 2;4 months (r(23) ϭ Ϫ0.75), but the effect was weaker at 3;4 months (r(23) ϭ Ϫ0.51). Acquisition of /c/, /ð̨/ and /l/ occurred earlier, relative to English, Swedish, Dutch and German. A frequency-bound practice effect on emerging consonants is proposed to account for the early emergence of /c/, /ð/̨ and /l/ in Icelandic.},

Prior research suggests some possible differences in acquisition across languages, however (Másdóttir and Stokes, 2016). The current study set out to examine acquisition of /r/ in Icelandic, focusing primarily on match (accuracy) and mismatch data for word-initial (WI) /r/-clusters, but also comparing /r/-clusters with WI singleton /r/ and /l/ plus /l/-clusters. Single-word data were collected for 27 Icelandic-speaking preschoolers with protracted phonological development (PPD) and compared with data from age- and gender-matched typically developing peers. Results showed lower match levels for clusters versus singletons, /r/ versus /l/ and the children with PPD. Most frequent substitutions were approximant [ð̞ ] and [l]. Younger children with PPD showed more deletion in clusters and a greater variety of substitutions for both consonants. The data support general cross-linguistic trends in rhotic acquisition with the [ð̞ ] substitution being one difference.},

Most traditional experimental studies have been interpreted as evidence for categorical perception. It is also argued in the present paper that more recent results taken as evidence against categorical perception are not unequivocally negative. Accordingly, further tests between continuous and categorical views of speech perception are necessary. In the present experiments, listeners were asked for continuous rather than discrete judgments in order to provide a more direct answer to this question. Subjects were asked to rate speech sounds according to where they fell on a particular speech continuum. The continua consisted of stop consonants varying in place ( / b e e / t o / d e e / ) or voicing ( / b e e / t o / p e e / ) or a vowel continuum varying f r o m / i / t o / 1 / . The distributions of rating responses of individual subjects were used to test quantitative models of categorical and continuous perception of acoustic features in speech. The results provide strong evidence against the categorical perception of speech contrasts, and contribute additional evidence for the role of continuous acoustic feature information in speech processing.},

Fox (1975), in an interesting attempt to widen the scope of the discussion, has argued that the anomalies are less serious than they appear, on the grounds that (               a               ) they do not interfere with the practical usefulness of the alphabet, and (               b               ) a more positive and more fundamental point—they reflect in some cases what appear to be linguistic universals, such as the potential use of retroflex consonants as a distinctive category and the widespread preference for voiced over voiceless nasals.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The aim of this study was to provide a cross-linguistic review of acquisition of consonant phonemes to inform speech-language pathologists' expectations of children's developmental capacity by (a) identifying characteristics of studies of consonant acquisition, (b) describing general principles of consonant acquisition, and (c) providing case studies for English, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish.                                         Method               A cross-linguistic review was undertaken of 60 articles describing 64 studies of consonant acquisition by 26,007 children from 31 countries in 27 languages: Afrikaans, Arabic, Cantonese, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Haitian Creole, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Jamaican Creole, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Maltese, Mandarin (Putonghua), Portuguese, Setswana (Tswana), Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Turkish, and Xhosa.                                         Results               Most studies were cross-sectional and examined single word production. Combining data from 27 languages, most of the world's consonants were acquired by 5;0 years;months old. By 5;0, children produced at least 93\% of consonants correctly. Plosives, nasals, and nonpulmonic consonants (e.g., clicks) were acquired earlier than trills, flaps, fricatives, and affricates. Most labial, pharyngeal, and posterior lingual consonants were acquired earlier than consonants with anterior tongue placement. However, there was an interaction between place and manner where plosives and nasals produced with anterior tongue placement were acquired earlier than anterior trills, fricatives, and affricates.                                         Conclusions               Children across the world acquire consonants at a young age. Five-year-old children have acquired most consonants within their ambient language; however, individual variability should be considered.

The endonymic language name Seenku [               s               ɛ̃́ː-               k               u               ̂] (also spelled on               Ethnologue               as Seeku) literally means ‘thing of the Sɛ̃ː ethnicity’, but it is widely known to outsiders as Sembla (variant spelling Sambla), which doubles as an exonym for the ethnicity. Seenku has two primary dialects, Northern and Southern, spoken in villages approximately 40 km west of Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso (see map in Figure 1). This study focuses on the more populous southern dialect, particularly the variety spoken in and around the large village center of Bouendé (local name [ɡ͡               b               e               ́               n               e               ́-ɡ               u               ̃̏]), with a population of approximately 12,000 speakers; the Northern dialect, spoken around the village center of Karangasso (local name [               t               ə               m               i               ̂]), has a population of approximately 5000 speakers and was the subject of a sketch grammar (Prost 1971). The southern dialect had until recently received little scholarly attention, with the exception of a Master's thesis on the morphophonology at the Université de Ouagadougou (Congo 2013), but is now the subject of the NSF Documenting Endangered Languages grant supporting this research (BCS-1664335).

Based on about 300 cognate sets from the authors’ field data (for Mawe and Aweti) and from Mello’s reconstruction (2000) for Proto-Tupi-Guarani (with additional information from other works; and with a few changes concerning certain doubtful features, such as the status of stem-final lenis consonants *r and *ß, and the distinction of *c and *č ), the consonants and vowels of Proto-Maweti-Guarani were reconstructed with the help of the traditional historical-comparative method. The development of the reconstructed segments is then traced from the protolanguage to each of the modern branches. A comparison with other claims made about Proto-Maweti-Guarani is given in the conclusion.},

The boy had developed secondary macroglossia, related to a disturbance of growth hormones, following a history of normal speech development. Perceptual analysis combined with acoustic analysis and static palatography is used to investigate the specific articulatory compensations arising from the macroglossia. The subset of sounds chosen for study were the denti-alveolar and alveolar plosives, fricatives, ejectives, nasal, lateral and trill produced in single words, as well as in short phrases. The phonetic analysis revealed both spatial and temporal atypicalities in the realisations of the sounds in question. Speaking rate was slow relative to his peer’s speech and attempts to increase speech rate resulted in dysfluent speech. Given the phonological system of Amharic, however, the atypical segmental realisations, while reducing both the intelligibility and acceptability of the participant’s speech production, did not result in loss of phonological contrasts.},

  abstract = {The authors studied the acquisition of nine \#sC clusters in 30 Croatian-speaking phonologically disordered children, aged between 3;8–7;0 years, by analysing their renditions of target words elicited in response to visual stimuli presented on a computer screen. Results did not support the idea that a greater jump in sonority from C1 to C2 would translate into a greater accuracy of productions. The percentage of correct realizations was high for /s/þnasal combinations (mean 85\%), and for approximants /j/ and /ʋ/ (mean 77\%) and stops (mean 73\%), with significantly lower scores for liquids /l/ and /r/ (mean 47\%). The difference between SSP-violating and SSP-following targets was not significant, and neither was the homorganicity of the target. The most frequent errors were substitution of the first consonant (i.e. /s/) while keeping the second one. These children are significantly different from the typically-developing group in two ways. First, retention of the first or the second consonant is not as frequent, and, second, /l/ is almost as difficult as /r/, as opposed to the typically-developing children who had no more difficulty with /l/ than with the other two approximants. Although cluster reduction is not the most common process in erroneous productions, the patterns emerged here generally agree with the findings from other languages.},

Its further subgrouping has remained a matter of some dispute. Early work placed Madurese in a Malayo-Javanic subgroup containing Javanese, Sundanese, and Malay (Dyen 1963). Glottolog and Ethnologue use the more recent ‘Malayo-Sumbawan’ classification (Adelaar 2005a), which puts Malayic, Chamic, and the Balinese-Sasak-Sumbawa group into one branch with Madurese and Sundanese in two other branches, to the exclusion of Javanese. Robert Blust, rejecting the Malayo-Sumbawan hypothesis, tentatively places Madurese in a Malayo-Chamic subgroup (Blust 2009), but also suggests (Blust 2010) that, as Madurese is lexically similar to Malay but phonologically and morphologically quite different, it may once have subgrouped with Javanese and later underwent heavy relexicalization due to language contact (see also discussion in Kluge 2017: 3).},

Traditionally, SAG is strongly geared towards SGG norms. The orientation towards SGG norms goes back to at least 1750, when Maria Theresia ordered the adoption of the Upper Saxonian norms in place at that time (Ebner 1969, Wiesinger 1989). Since then, SAG pronunciation is modelled on SGG and Austrian newsreaders are instructed according to the norms of Duden's (2005)               Aussprachewörterbuch               and Siebs (1958, with an addendum for Austria) (Wächter-Kollpacher 1995, Soukup \& Moosmüller 2011). This procedure leads to an inconsistent usage of SGG features in Austrian broadcasting media (Wiesinger 2009, Soukup \& Moosmüller 2011, Hildenbrandt \& Moosmüller 2015). Therefore, from a methodological point of view, pronunciation used in the Austrian broadcasting media is unsuitable for defining SAG (Moosmüller 2015).},

Although these standards are often met with frustration by users, they nevertheless provide language researchers and programmers with a consistent computational architecture needed to process, publish and analyze lexical data from the world’s languages. Thus we bring to light common, but not always transparent, pitfalls which researchers face when working with Unicode and IPA. Having identified and overcome these pitfalls involved in making writing systems and character encodings syntactically and semantically interoperable (to the extent that they can be), we created a suite of open-source Python and R tools to work with languages using orthography profiles that describe author- or document-specific orthographic conventions. In this cookbook we describe a formal specification of orthography profiles and provide recipes using open source tools to show how users can segment text, analyze it, identify errors, and to transform it into different written forms for comparative linguistics research.},

  abstract = {Two factors have been proposed as the main determinants of phonological typology: channel bias, phonetically systematic errors in transmission, and analytic bias, cognitive predispositions making learners more receptive to some patterns than others. Much of typology can be explained equally well by either factor, making them hard to distinguish empirically. This study presents evidence that analytic bias is strong enough to create typological asymmetries in a case where channel bias is controlled. I show that (i) phonological dependencies between the height of two vowels are typologically more common than dependencies between vowel height and consonant voicing, (ii) the phonetic precursors of the height-height and height-voice patterns are equally robust and (iii) in two experiments, English speakers learned a height-height pattern and a voice-voice pattern better than a height-voice pattern. I conclude that both factors contribute to typology, and discuss hypotheses about their interaction.},

  abstract = {This article re-examines the various models and empirical bases for the dorsalization of apical rhotics at the light of relatively recent observations made by Santerre (1982) by means of x-ray motion pictures, bringing new evidence that this change need not necessarily be abrupt, as often claimed (cf. Bloomfield 1933), but may involve gradual changes in the relative strength of primary and secondary articulations of the rhotic, as hypothesized much earlier by Jespersen (1889). Santerre’s study also supports Jespersen’s claim that a uvular fricative/approximant [ʁ] develops earlier in the dorsalization process, while the uvular trilled [ʀ] appears later as a reinforced variant of this fricative/approximant [ʁ], probably on social and communicative grounds. Santerre’s study of a single Montreal informant was conducted in the years 1970 at a time when a radical evolution from apical to dorsal articulation was under way in that city – an evolution well documented in a series of sociolinguistic studies (cf. Clermont \& Cedergren 1979; Sankoff \& Blondeau 2007), which conclude that this development is strongly conditioned by social factors and represents the spread across the linguistic community of a socially prestigious norm. The change observed by Santerre involves a classic form of lenition in syllable-final position that need not have been triggered by social factors. On the other hand, and contrary to implicit claims in Jespersen’s hypothesis, the dorsalization in other contexts does not develop at the same pace. One may hypothesize that dorsalization normally begins in word-final or preconsonantal position and is later generalized elsewhere, a process that might be sensitive to social factors. Imperfect learning by children during the early stages of acquisition – not examined in this article – may have been another factor responsible for the rapid spread of dorsalization in Montreal, as hypothesized by Passy (1891a) for similar changes in Europe, who argues that the child’s immature uvular rhotic, normally abandoned in the later stages of acquisition, may be retained when it becomes socially valued in the community.},

  abstract = {As the result of migration, many languages have a homeland variety and one or more so-called heritage varieties spoken in the countries of migration, often in Europe, North America, or Australia. One of these is Ambon Malay, a language originally spoken in the Central Moluccas, Indonesia, but also spoken as a heritage language in the Netherlands. 00When one language is spoken alongside another one, contact-induced change is expected to occur. This change inevitably leads a heritage language to diverge from its homeland counterpart and to converge toward the socially dominant language. This dissertation explores contact-induced change in heritage Ambon Malay, as spoken by Dutch-Ambon Malay bilinguals. In order to investigate divergence and convergence, the present study systematically compares heritage Ambon Malay to its homeland variety, to Dutch, and to the language of first generation speakers in the Netherlands. The comparison, both quantitative and qualitative, is based on semi-spontaneous speech data and it focuses on four grammatical areas: nominal modification, aspect marking, give-constructions and resultative constructions. 00The most pervasive type of contact-induced change encountered in heritage Ambon Malay is?change in frequency?, namely a change in preference for one construction over another equally possible construction when the preferred construction is shared with Dutch. As a result, heritage Ambon Malay grammar is converging toward Dutch and diverging from the homeland variety. Beside Dutch influence, divergence from the homeland variety is also accounted for by the quantitatively and qualitatively different language input that heritage speakers have received in the county of migration},

Phonemes are contrastive phonological units, and allophones are their various concrete realizations, which are predictable from phonological context. While phonemic representations are language specific, phonetic representations (stated in terms of (allo)phones) are much closer to a universal (language-independent) transcription. AlloVera allows the training of speech recognition models that output phonetic transcriptions in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), regardless of the input language. We show that a “universal” allophone model, Allosaurus, built with AlloVera, outperforms “universal” phonemic models and language-specific models on a speech-transcription task. We explore the implications of this technology (and related technologies) for the documentation of endangered and minority languages. We further explore other applications for which AlloVera will be suitable as it grows, including phonological typology.},

These variables were compared with acquisition data of 20 similar phonemes used by 70 Englishspeaking children. Results indicate Xhosa-speaking children master most phonemes at an earlier age than their English-speaking counteiparts. Xhosa speakers produce a similar number of errors on the same phonemes and make similar errors as English speakers, but Xhosa speakers make fewer errors on stops and fricatives. The data support the notion of the existence of phonological universals at least with the two groups studied.},

  abstract = {To assess a phonological theory, we often compare its predictions to phonetic observations. This can be complicated, however, because it requires a theoretical model that maps from phonological representations to articulatory and acoustic observations. In this study we are concerned with the question of how phonetic observations are interpreted in relation to phonological theories. Specifically, we argue that deviations of observations from theoretical predictions do not necessitate the rejection of the theoretical assumptions. We critically discuss the problem of overinterpretation of phonetic measures by using syllable coordination for different speaker groups within Articulatory Phonology. It is shown that surface variation can be explained without necessitating substantial revision of the underlying phonological theory. These results are discussed with respect to two types of interpretational errors in the literature. The first involves the proliferation of phonological categories in order to accommodate variation, and the second the rejection of a phonological theory because the model which generates its predictions is overly simplified.},

Aims and Objectives: To assess the shape of the soft palate in normal individuals, classify the soft palate and investigate the differences in the size and shape of velar morphology in both the genders and age groups. Materials and Methodology: The study was conducted using 200 lateral cephalograms which were taken with digital orthophos XG machine. Radiographs were collected and soft palate morphologies were analyzed using Sirona software. Soft palate length and thickness were also calculated. Results: Increase in soft palate length was observed till the age of 30 years and showed a decrease thereafter. Velar width was more in males and showed variation in different age groups. Three additional morphological variants of soft palate were found. The soft palate length and width was significantly higher in males than females. Conclusion: Soft palate morphologies are variable. Type 1 variant was observed most commonly followed by Types 2 and 3. Thus, it will be beneficial for diagnosis and management of OSA and also will be helpful in assessing the changes in the morphologies in OSMF patients.},

  abstract = {1. What follows is a sketch of the phonology of the English spoken in Emper, Co. Westmeath. Emper is a pocket of fertile country partly enclosed in a loop of the River Inny and situate some eleven or twelve miles to the north-west of Mullingar. The population, fluctuating about two hundred souls, is composed mostly of farmers and farm labourers. They are engaged in mixed farming, that is tillage, stock-raising, and dairying; and are a settled community in that the farms in most cases have been occupied by the same families for generations. It is difficult to say at what date exactly the people of Emper ceased to speak Irish and became English speakers. The evidence is scanty and entirely oral, yet sufficient to warrant the conclusion that at some time after the middle of the eighteenth century, and certainly before 1800, Emper had become English speaking. The findings and conclusions below are based on my own (dialect) pronunciation and my memory of auditory observation of the speech of the older stratum of the inhabitants, and especially of those born before 1900. This is my vernacular speech and I have never lost touch with it.},

  abstract = {Purpose: As many as 74\% of residents in long-term care (LTC) are anticipated to have swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). Low food intake is commonly reported in persons with swallowing problems, but food intake may also be affected by fatigue in the swallowing muscles. As fatigue sets in during mealtimes, the strength of the tongue may decline. Tongue strength is also known to decline with age but it is unclear how this functional change may influence food intake. In this pilot study, we explored the relationship between tongue strength and meal consumption in persons not previously diagnosed with dysphagia. Methods: The Iowa Oral Performance Instrument was used to collect maximum anterior isometric tongue-palate pressures from 12 LTC residents (5 male; mean age: 85, range 65e99). Residents were also screened for dysphagia with applesauce and a water swallow test. Each resident was observed at three different meals to record the length of time taken to eat the meal, amount of food consumed, and any indication of overt signs of swallowing difficulty (e.g. coughing). Results: Residents who displayed observable swallowing difficulties at mealtimes had significantly lower tongue strength than those without swallowing difficulties (p {$<$} 0.01). Those with lower tongue strength took significantly longer to complete meals (p {$<$} 0.05) and consumed less food. Tongue strength was not predictive of performance on the water screen and the water swallow test was not a good predictor of which participants were observed to display mealtime difficulties. Conclusion: Among seniors in long term care, reduced tongue strength is associated with longer meal times, reduced food consumption, and the presence of observable signs of swallowing difficulty. Further exploration of these relationships is warranted.},

The language is diglossic, with the formal register used in written media and orally in formal settings. Colloquial Malayalam, for which there is no standard orthography, varies by region and social community (Asher \& Kumari 1997). The speech illustrated below is representative of the variety spoken by the Namboodiri subcaste of Brahmins in and around Kochi, a city in central Kerala. The Namboodiri subcaste was traditionally a land-owning priestly class, and until relatively recently, the community was very insular. Consequently, the dialect differed from standard Malayalam as it is spoken today; this is discussed in some detail in U. Namboodiripad (1989, personal communication).},

  abstract = {Scottish Gaelic is a minority language of Scotland spoken by approximately 58,000 people, or 1\% of the Scottish population (speaker numbers from the 2011 Census available in National Records of Scotland 2015). Here, we refer to the language as ‘Gaelic’, pronounced in British English as /ɡalɪk/, as is customary within the Gaelic-speaking community. In Gaelic, the language is referred to as               Gàidhlig               /kaːlɪc/. Gaelic is a Celtic language, closely related to Irish (MacAulay 1992, Ní Chasaide 1999, Gillies 2009). Although Gaelic was widely spoken across much of Scotland in medieval times (Withers 1984, Clancy 2009), the language has recently declined in traditional areas such as the western seaboard and western islands of Scotland and is now considered ‘definitely endangered’ by UNESCO classification (Moseley 2010). Analysis of the location of Gaelic speakers in Scotland and maps from the most recent Census in 2011 can be found in National Records of Scotland (2015). Figure 1 shows the location of Gaelic speakers in Scotland as a percentage of the inhabitants aged over three in each Civil Parish who reported being able to speak Gaelic in the 2011 Census.},

However, Bayesian phylogenetic models are complex, and analyses are often carried out using default settings, which may not be appropriate. Here, we summarize the major features of Bayesian phylogenetic inference and discuss Bayesian computation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), the diagnosis of an MCMC run, and ways of summarising the MCMC sample. We discuss the specification of the prior, the choice of the substitution model, and partitioning of the data. Finally, we provide a list of common Bayesian phylogenetic software and provide recommendations as to their use.},

Yet they tend to display consistent patterns of behavior in relation to other phonemes within the phonological system. In this article, I argue that this apparently conflicting behavior among r-sounds is a direct result of the lack of positive content in their phonological representations. That is, the basic phonological structure of a rhotic is an unspecified consonant sonorant, which I define based on their underspecified contrastive oppositions to other phonemic categories. This proposal captures the seemingly arbitrary relationship between the phonetics and phonology present among r-sounds and accounts for why corresponding degrees of divergent surface forms are not attested for other phonological categories.},

The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together for the first time the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks--},

  abstract = {While considerable efforts have been expended to develop snore-driven markers for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), there is little emphasis on the relationship between the human upper airway (UA) dimensions and the attributes of snores. This paper aims to investigate the acoustical and perceptual impacts of changing the crosssectional areas (CSA) of the pharynx and oral cavity on the production of snores. Synthetic snores were generated based on the source-filter theory, whereas natural snores were recorded from 40 snorers during nocturnal polysomnography. First formant frequency (F1), spectral peak frequency (PF), and psychoacoustic metrics (loudness, sharpness, roughness, fluctuation strength, and annoyance) of CSA perturbations were examined, completed with diagnostic appraisal of F1 and PF for single- and mixed-gender groupings using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results show that (1) narrowing the pharyngeal airway consistently increases F1, but not for PF; and (2) altering the airway dimensions yield no considerable differences in perception of snore sounds, but indirectly affect the psychoacoustics by changing the dynamics of snore source flow. Diagnostic outcomes for all groupings (p-value {$<$} 0.0001) demonstrate that F1 is more capable of distinguishing apneic and benign snorers than PF due to the close association of F1 with the UA anatomical structures. Correlation exists between the UA anatomy and the properties of snores; there is a promising future for developing snore-driven screening tools for OSA.},

It provides a description of the range of segmental variability and explores the relationship between articulatory and temporal variability. It also discusses instances of common connected speech processes including assimilations and deletions. Data from two Greek speakers producing a monologue was recorded with the technique of electropalatography (Reading EPG system). The results indicated that segmental variability ranges over a continuum from over-articulated to under-articulated forms, i.e. fully articulated tokens to very open articulations. In addition, duration dependent variability was found to be a function of the production characteristics of the consonant. Evidence of both gradient and categorical changes in spontaneous speech were suggested by the data and are discussed with reference to current theoretical frameworks.},

  abstract = {This study demonstrates that listeners use lexical knowledge in perceptual learning of speech sounds. Dutch listeners first made lexical decisions on Dutch words and nonwords. The final fricative of 20 critical words had been replaced by an ambiguous sound, between [f] and [s]. One group of listeners heard ambiguous [f]-final words (e.g., [WItlo?], from witlof, chicory) and unambiguous [s]-final words (e.g., naaldbos, pine forest). Another group heard the reverse (e.g., ambiguous [na:ldbo?], unambiguous witlof). Listeners who had heard [?] in [f]-final words were subsequently more likely to categorize ambiguous sounds on an [f]–[s] continuum as [f] than those who heard [?] in [s]-final words. Control conditions ruled out alternative explanations based on selective adaptation and contrast. Lexical information can thus be used to train categorization of speech. This use of lexical information differs from the on-line lexical feedback embodied in interactive models of speech perception. In contrast to online feedback, lexical feedback for learning is of benefit to spoken word recognition (e.g., in adapting to a newly encountered dialect).},

This chapter discusses the extent to which sound patterns in language can be derived, such as theorems from first principles, the latter being facts that are empirically verifiable and pertinent as well to domains other than speech. The function of the speech mechanism may be considered the conversion of static or slowly varying air pressure into the rapid air pressure variations that are called sound. This task is accomplished by what is in effect an interconnected series of chambers whose volumes, and thus, also air pressures, may be varied by piston-like mechanisms and whose input and output of air flow are regulated by various valves.},

  abstract = {A Saussurean communication system exists when an entire communicating population uses a single ‘language’ that maps states unambiguously onto symbols and then back into the original states. This paper describes a number of simulations performed with a genetic algorithm to investigate the conditions necessary for such communication systems to evolve. The first simulation shows that Saussurean communication evolves in the simple case where direct selective pressure is placed on individuals to be both good transmitters and good receivers. The second simulation demonstrates that, in the more realistic case where selective pressure is only placed on doing well as a receiver, Saussurean communication fails to evolve. Two methods, inspired by research on the Prisoner’s Dilemma, are used to attempt to solve this problem. The third simulation shows that, even in the absence of selective pressure on transmission, Saussurean communication can evolve if individuals interact multiple times with the same communication partner and are given the ability to respond differentially based on past interaction. In the fourth simulation, spatially organized populations are used, and it is shown that this allows Saussurean communication to evolve through kin selection.},

The study examines the discrimination and the identification of Italian liquids (/l/, /r/, /ll/, /rr/ and /ʎ/), while comparing the results with those of replicated perception experiments of Spanish liquids (/l/, /ɾ/ and /r/). Japanese listeners showed poor discrimination performance on Italian /l/-/r/ and very good discrimination performance on the other Italian liquid contrasts (/l/-/ll/, /l/-/rr/, /ll/-/r/, /ll/-/rr/, /r/-/rr/, /l/-/ʎ/, /ll/-/ʎ/, /r/-/ʎ/ and /rr/-/ʎ/). The listeners perceptually assimilated Italian /l/ and /r/ to Japanese /r/, Italian /ll/ to Japanese /Qr/, Italian /rr/ to Japanese /rur/, and Italian /ʎ/ to Japanese /rj/. The findings indicate that PAM accounts for the perception of Italian liquids by Japanese listeners.},

  abstract = {Strauss (1993) and other anthropologists have classified Japreria as a dialect of the Yukpa language. From the linguistic viewpoint, Durbin and Seijas (1972) and Mosonyi (2000) have suggested that Japreria is a dialectal variation. In Oquendo (1998), through a submorphemic unit analysis both of the pronominal system and of the kinship system, proves Japreria to be a Cariban language distict fron Yukpa. The aim in this paper is to demonstrate that the voiced uvular[R] and the voiced labio-dental approximant [í] constitute phenomena of “phonological culture” in Palmer’s (1996) sense, which allow the differenciation ofl Japreria from Yukpa. This paper analyzes different types of syllabic structures both in Japreria and in Yukpa and finds that the syllabic group cvc with post-alveolar fricative [š] in final position followed by cv generates the voiced uvular, while the voiced bilabial fricative of Yukpa becomes a labio-dental approximant in Japreria. These features are not in accordance of the foundations of Mattéi- Müller and Hendley’s (1990) approach, which characterized caribe languages. It is supposed the these differences between authors is due to the proto of these Caribe lanbguages in the north-west.},

It is spoken in the Eastern Amazonian region of Ecuador on the Napo River above the mouth of the Rio Coca, primarily on three tributaries: the Misahualli, the Arajuno, and the Ansuc. Tena Quichua is bounded on the North and East by Napo Quichua and on the South by Pastaza Quichua. Previous research on the division of Ecuadorian dialects is summarized by Carpenter (1984: 3–4). Although it is beyond the scope of this Illustration, we hope that our description of Tena Quichua will prove useful in future work on the relations between these three Amazonian dialects of Ecuadorian Quichua. Below, a brief summary of Tena dialect identification and formation is given, followed by a description of present-day bilingualism in the region and data collection procedures.},

A single-word list included 15 WI /r/-clusters, 9 /l/-clusters and 3 singleton /r/s and /l/s each. Results showed significantly higher match (accuracy) levels for rhotics in the TD group. Among rhotic clusters, TD children showed highest match levels for labial clusters, and the PPD group, for /dr/. Match levels did not differ significantly between singletons and clusters or targets in stressed versus unstressed syllables. Substitutions were more frequent than deletions, and children with PPD had more frequent and varied mismatch patterns; for the PPD group, [l] was the most frequent substitution for /r/ and for the TD group, other rhotics. The study provides additional criterion reference data on Slovenian phonological development.},

The number of native Kabiye speakers is estimated at 730,000, with approximately 700,000 speakers living in Togo, 30,000 in Benin, and a very small number in Ghana (Grimes 2000: 242). The original homeland of the Kabiye people is in Northeastern Togo, with the region of Kozah serving as the community's cultural center. From the early 20th century, however, the community began to spread southward and now encompasses locations in the central and southern parts of Togo, as well as in the neighboring countries (Ali-Napo 1997: 20).},

Not only was the native population decimated after contact with foreigners and foreign diseases but the language itself came under attack after the occupation of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893 (for more on Hawaiian history, see Coffman 2009, Sai 2011). Children were thereafter banned from speaking Hawaiian at school and indeed ‘physical punishment for using it could be harsh’ (Native Hawaiian Study Commission 1983: 196). In the decades that followed, Hawaiian was gradually replaced by an English-based creole (HCE or Hawaiʻi Creole English) for practically all Hawaiʻi-born children (Bikerton \& Wilson 1987, also Sakoda \& Siegel 2003). By the end of the 1970s, most surviving Hawaiian speakers were over 70 years old and fewer than 50 speakers were under the age of 18 (Kawaiʻaeʻa, Housman \& Alencastre 2007).},

  abstract = {English is one of eleven official languages in South Africa, but there is limited information on children’s acquisition of English and other languages in this context. This paper describes speech development in 308 children aged 3;0–5;11 acquiring South African English in Cape Town. The study focused on English speech acquisition, although children were grouped by language background into monolingual, isiXhosa bilingual, Afrikaans bilingual and trilingual groups. The primary objective was to describe phonetic and phonological acquisition (percentage consonants and vowels correct (PCC and PVC); phonetic inventory and phonological processes) by children’s age and language background. As a secondary objective we described the prevalence of speech disorders in the sample using Dodd’s (2005) framework. The Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology was used to assess participants with modified scoring criteria appropriate for the context. Phonological processes and inventories were broadly comparable to normative data for English speech acquisition documented in the literature, and a progression was observed with increasing age. PCC and PVC were similar for children within age bands despite different language backgrounds. Bilingual children showed aspects of English phonological development linked to their L1, and some differences in phonological processes were observed. Approximately 9\% of children (n = 28) had speech difficulties, with 75\% of this group having a speech delay. The study highlights the importance of adapting speech assessments for use with populations that differ from the originally intended audience. This work contributes to knowledge of typical speech development in South Africa and in multilingual contexts more generally.},

Equivalently, we represent a graph with a quantum mechanical state and study its von Neumann entropy. At the graph-theoretic level, this quantity may be interpreted as a measure of regularity; it tends to be larger in relation to the number of connected components, long paths and nontrivial symmetries. When the set of vertices is asymptotically large, we prove that regular graphs and the complete graph have equal entropy, and specifically it turns out to be maximum. On the other hand, when the number of edges is fixed, graphs with large cliques appear to minimize the entropy.},

  abstract = {Objective: A collapsible upper airway is a common cause of obstructive sleep apnea. The exact pathophysiology leading to a more collapsible airway is not well understood. A progressive neuropathy of the soft palate and pharyngeal dilators may be associated with the progression of snoring to OSA. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the international literature investigating the neurophysiologic changes in the soft palate and uvula that contribute to progression from snoring to OSA. Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE and 4 other databases were systematically searched through July 4, 2017. Eligibility: (1) Patients: controls, snoring or OSA patients (2) Intervention: neuromuscular evaluation of the palate and/or uvula (3) Comparison: differences between controls, snoring and OSA patients (4) Outcomes: neuromuscular outcomes (5) Study design: Peer reviewed publications of any design. Results: 845 studies were screened, 76 were downloaded in full text form and thirty-one studies met criteria. Histological studies of the soft palate demonstrated diffuse inflammatory changes, muscular changes consistent with neuropathy, and neural aberrancies. Sensory testing studies provided heterogeneous outcomes though the majority favored neuronal dysfunction. Studies have consistently demonstrated that increasing severity of snoring and sleep apnea is associated with worsening sensory nerve function of the palate in association with atrophic histological changes to the nerves and muscle fibers of the soft palate and uvula. Conclusions: Recent evidence highlighted in this systematic review implicates the role of neurogenic pathology underlying the loss of soft palate and/or uvular tone in the progression of snoring to sleep apnea.},

  abstract = {The goals of this study were to investigate the developmental patterns of acquisition of the Spanish tap and trill by L1 Mandarin–L2 English–L3 Spanish speakers, and to examine the extent to which the L1 and the L2 influenced the L3 productions. Twenty L1 Mandarin–L2 English–L3 Spanish speakers performed a reading task that elicited production of rhotics from the speakers’ L3 Spanish, L2 English, and L1 Mandarin, as well as the L2 English flap. The least proficient speakers produced a single substitution initially, generally [l]. The same non-target segment was produced for both rhotics, mirroring the results of previous studies investigating L1 English–L2 Spanish speakers, indicating that this may be a universal simplification strategy. In contrast to previous work on L1 English speakers, the L1 Mandarin–L2 English–L3 Spanish speakers who had acquired the tap did not tend to use it as the primary substitute for the trill. Overall, the L1 was a stronger source of cross-linguistic influence. Nonetheless, evidence of positive and negative L2 transfer was also found. The L2 flap allophone facilitated acquisition of the L3 tap, whereas non-target productions of the L2 /ô/ were also observed, revealing that both previously learned languages were possible sources of cross-linguistic influence.},

We utilized a large conversational speech database to generate statistics about the frequency of occurrence of medial flaps. Results confirmed the prevalence of flapping in American English. Low frequency words showed a redistribution of variants from [U] to [t] compared to dominant flapping in high frequency words. A similar redistribution of variant production occurred for morphologically complex words (e.g. dirty) compared with morphologically simple words (e.g. water). A second analysis examining vowel length prior to medial /t/ and medial /d/ showed that, while both stops were pronounced as a flap, the vowel preceding medial /d/ tended to the longer. These results were discussed in reference to potential processes in recognizing spoken words.},

So-called 'inherent' geminates are also found to be long post-consonantally, contrary to received wisdom, and do not form 'supergeminates' in conditions of postlexical gemination. Formant analysis of laterals reveals possible non-durational properties of gemination, with evidence for a more palatalised tongue configuration in geminates. Implications for the structural status of gemination are discussed.},

Tap clusters versus singleton trills were variable in order of mastery, some children mastering clusters first, and others, the trill. Rhotics were acquired later than /l/. In early development, mismatches (errors) involved primarily deletion of taps; where substitutions occurred, [j] frequently replaced tap. In later development, [l] more frequently replaced tap; where taps did occur, vowel epenthesis sometimes occurred.

  abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the musculus uvulae morphology in vivo in adults with normal velopharyngeal anatomy and to examine sex and race effects on the muscle morphology. We also sought to provide a preliminary comparison of musculus uvulae morphology in adults with normal velopharyngeal anatomy to adults with repaired cleft palate. Methods: Three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging data and Amira 5.5 Visualization Modeling software were used to evaluate the musculus uvulae in 70 participants without cleft palate and 6 participants with cleft palate. Muscle length, thickness, width, and volume were compared among participant groups. Results: Analysis of covariance analysis did not yield statistically significant differences in musculus uvulae length, thickness, width, or volume by race or sex among participants without cleft palate when the effect of body size was accounted for. Two-sample t test revealed that the musculus uvulae in participants with repaired cleft palate is significantly shorter (P ¼ .008, 13.65 mm vs 16.07 mm) and has less volume (P ¼ .002, 51.08 mm3 vs 97.62 mm3) than participants without cleft palate. Conclusion: In adults with normal velopharyngeal anatomy, the musculus uvulae is a cylindrical oblong-shaped muscle lying on the nasal surface of the soft palate, with its greatest bulk located just nasal to the levator veli palatini muscle sling. In participants with repaired cleft palate, the musculus uvulae is substantially reduced in volume. This diminished muscle bulk located just at the point where the palate contacts the posterior pharyngeal wall may contribute to velopharyngeal insufficiency in children with repaired cleft palate.},

The reader is also referred to Jones (1957, and 1967: 212 ff.) and Fudge (1970) for discussions on that basis. However, we can achieve additional insight into the problem of defining the phoneme if we classify the views of the phoneme, this time, on a populational basis. By this, we mean whether the phoneme is defined as a unit of (1) an idiolect, (2) a dialect, (3) a multidialect, or (4) a supralect.},

Participants were 14 Cypriot-Greek speaking typically developing toddlers, examined at ages 24, 28, 32 and 36 months. Spontaneously produced and elicited glossable utterances were used in constructing each child’s inventory. Findings revealed an increase of segmental acquisition across all age levels. Group trend analysis for manner and place of articulation indicated bilabial and alveolar stops and nasals to be among the earlier segments to develop. A word medial position advantage was also evident. The findings are discussed in terms of phonological universals and language-specific factors.

  abstract = {Snoring is a prevalent disorder affecting 20–40\% of the general population. The mechanism of snoring is vibration of anatomical structures in the pharyngeal airway. Flutter of the soft palate accounts for the harsh aspect of the snoring sound. Natural or drug-induced sleep is required for its appearance. Snoring is subject to many influences such as body position, sleep stage, route of breathing and the presence or absence of sleep-disordered breathing. Its presentation may be variable within or between nights. While snoring is generally perceived as a social nuisance, rating of its noisiness is subjective and, therefore, inconsistent. Objective assessment of snoring is important to evaluate the effect of treatment interventions. Moreover, snoring carries information relating to the site and degree of obstruction of the upper airway. If evidence for monolevel snoring at the site of the soft palate is provided, the patient may benefit from palatal surgery. These considerations have inspired researchers to scrutinize the acoustic characteristics of snoring events. Similarly to speech, snoring is produced in the vocal tract. Because of this analogy, existing techniques for speech analysis have been applied to evaluate snoring sounds. It appears that the pitch of the snoring sound is in the low-frequency range ({$<$}500 Hz) and corresponds to a fundamental frequency with associated harmonics. The pitch of snoring is determined by vibration of the soft palate, while nonpalatal snoring is more ‘noise-like’, and has scattered energy content in the higher spectral sub-bands ({$>$}500 Hz). To evaluate acoustic properties of snoring, sleep nasendoscopy is often performed. Recent evidence suggests that the acoustic quality of snoring is markedly different in drug-induced sleep as compared with natural sleep. Most often, palatal surgery alters sound characteristics of snoring, but is no cure for this disorder. It is uncertain whether the perceived improvement after palatal surgery, as judged by the bed partner, is due to an altered sound spectrum. Whether some acoustic aspects of snoring, such as changes in pitch, have predictive value for the presence of obstructive sleep apnea is at present not sufficiently substantiated.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Vietnamese is spoken by over 89 million people in Vietnam and it is one of the most commonly spoken languages other than English in the US, Canada and Australia. This study defines between one and nine different dialects of Vietnamese spoken in Vietnam. In Vietnamese schools, children learn Standard Vietnamese which is based on the northern dialect; however, if they live in other regions they may speak a different dialect at home. Method: This paper describes the differences between the consonants, semivowels, vowels, diphthongs and tones for four dialects: Standard, northern, central and southern Vietnamese. Result: The number and type of initial consonants differs per dialect (i.e. Standard ¼ 23, northern ¼ 20, central ¼ 23, southern ¼ 21). For example, the letter ‘‘r’’ is pronounced in the Standard and central dialects as the retroflex /œ/, northern dialect as the voiced alveolar fricative /z/ or the trilled /r/ and in the southern dialect as the voiced velar fricative /å/. Additionally, the letter ‘‘v’’ is pronounced in the Standard, northern and central dialects as the voiced labiodental fricative /v/, the southern dialect as the voiced palatal approximant /j/ and in the lower northern dialect (Ninh Binh) as the voiceless labiodental fricative /f/. Similarly, the number of final consonants differs per dialect (i.e. Standard ¼ 6, northern ¼ 10, central ¼ 10, southern ¼ 8). Finally, the number and type of tones differs per dialect (i.e. Standard ¼ 6, northern ¼ 6, central ¼ 5, southern ¼ 5). Conclusion: Understanding differences between Vietnamese dialects is important so that speech-language pathologists and educators provide appropriate services to people who speak Vietnamese.},

  abstract = {To date, there has been little research done on phonological acquisition in the Malay language of typically developing Malay-speaking children. This study serves to fill this gap by providing a systematic description of Malay consonant acquisition in a large cohort of preschool-aged children between 4- and 6-years-old. In the study, 326 Malay-dominant speaking children were assessed using a picture naming task that elicited 53 single words containing all the primary consonants in Malay. Two main analyses were conducted to study their consonant acquisition: (1) age of customary and mastery production of consonants; and (2) consonant accuracy. Results revealed that Malay children acquired all the syllable-initial and syllable-final consonants before 4;06-years-old, with the exception of syllable-final /s/, /h/ and /l/ which were acquired after 5;06-years-old. The development of Malay consonants increased gradually from 4- to 6 years old, with female children performing better than male children. The accuracy of consonants based on manner of articulation showed that glides, affricates, nasals, and stops were higher than fricatives and liquids. In general, syllable-initial consonants were more accurate than syllable-final consonants while consonants in monosyllabic and disyllabic words were more accurate than polysyllabic words. These findings will provide significant information for speech-language pathologists for assessing Malay-speaking children and designing treatment objectives that reflect the course of phonological development in Malay.},

  abstract = {Isthmus Zapotec (autoglossonym: [dìʤàˈzàˑ]) is the common name used for a variety of Zapotec (Otomanguean family) spoken on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, Mexico (Suárez 1983: xvi; Campbell 1997: 158). It is now officially listed by the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI 2008) as ‘zapoteco de la planicie costera’ (‘coastal plain Zapotec’) to distinguish it from other varieties of Zapotec spoken on the Isthmus. It is the mother tongue of many inhabitants of various cities and towns, as well as many smaller communities (INALI 2008), with some lexical, syntactic and phonetic variation between towns only a few kilometers apart. The ISO 639-3 code for this variety is zai. Since the most recent census figures do not separate out the varieties of Zapotec, and have not done so reliably when attempted, official statistics as to the number of speakers of Isthmus Zapotec are not available. (The               Ethnologue               (Lewis 2009) cites the 1990 census as listing 85,000 speakers; that figure must have been an interpretation of other statistics in the census.) INALI (personal communication, September 2008) estimates the current number to be about 104,000. In the city of Tehuantepec, the language is no longer widely used. In certain other locations, including Juchitán de Zaragoza, Spanish is becoming the dominant or the only language spoken by many people born after about 1990, although Zapotec is dominant in many outlying towns, including San Blas Atempa. Mature speakers have remarked that young people who are not fluent do not use tones correctly. Isthmus Zapotec has had active writers, including poets and novelists, since the first half of the twentieth century, well before an orthography was officially established (               Alfabeto popular               1956), but reading and writing of the language are still not taught in schools in the region.},

  abstract = {Tongue strength is routinely evaluated in clinical swallowing evaluations since lingual weakness is an established contributor to dysphagia. Tongue strength may be clinically quantified by the maximum isometric tongue pressure (MIP) generated by the tongue against the palate; however, wide ranges in normal performance remain to be fully explained. Although orthodontic theory has long suggested a relation between lingual function and oral cavity dimensions, little attention has been given to the potential influence of oral and palatal structure(s) on healthy variance in MIP generation. Therefore, anterior and posterior tongue strength measures and oropalatal dimensions were obtained across 147 healthy adults (aged 18-88~years). Age was confirmed as a significant, independent predictor explaining approximately 10.2\% of the variance in anterior tongue strength, but not a significant predictor of posterior tongue strength. However, oropalatal dimensions predicted anterior tongue strength with over three times the predictive power of age alone (p~{$<~$}.001). Significant models for anterior tongue strength (R 2~=~.457) and posterior tongue strength (R 2~=~.283) included a combination of demographic predictors (i.e., age and/or gender) and oropalatal dimensions. Palatal width, estimated tongue volume, and gender were significant predictors of posterior tongue strength (p~{$<~$}.001). Therefore, oropalatal dimensions may warrant consideration when accurately differentiating between pathological lingual weakness and healthy individual difference.},

It turns out that there are more apical [r]s in dialects than in French, more so in a syllable onset or an internal coda than in a word-final position, and more so in elderly speakers than in younger ones. By contrast, we did not find any apical [r] in the regional French varieties of speakers under 65 years old. Faced with this situation, we offer some elements of discussion about the interface between phonology and sociolinguistics.

Although lenition from the Scottish trill towards approximants and more vocalic realisations should be sensitive to word frequency, findings from spontaneous speech in 18 speakers do not show a significant correlation between non-rhotic forms and lexical frequency. Consequently, we raise questions on the coherence across methodological practices on the one hand, and on the interpretation of observed frequency effects on different levels, on the other.},

  abstract = {Cette thèse comporte deux volets principaux : elle présente, d’une part, une réflexion sur la prononciation de l’anglais en Écosse et offre, d’autre part, une analyse de divers phénomènes segmentaux à partir d’une enquête sociophonétique menée à Ayr sur un corpus oral de locuteurs contemporains. La réflexion générale analyse les rapports entre anglais standard et écossais à la fois du point de vue diachronique et synchronique. Nous fournissons une description détaillée du Scottish Standard English (SSE) et, en particulier, d’un ensemble de processus morpho-phonologiques désigné par le terme «Règle de la Longueur Vocalique Écossaise» («Scottish Vowel Length Rule»). L’examen de cette «règle» constitue l’axe le plus important de nos recherches avec pour objectif une possible amélioration des modèles descriptifs et phonologiques de ce phénomène. Le cadre empirique de notre étude est constitué par le projet linguistique PAC (« La Phonologie de l’Anglais Contemporain ») fondé sur une méthodologie labovienne classique composée de divers échelons stylistiques du langage observé. Les données ainsi recueillies sur 12 locuteurs nous permettent d’explorer du point de vue sociolinguistique la variété de l’anglais parlé à Ayr et d’offrir une analyse phonétique approfondie des variables étudiées. Les mesures acoustiques effectuées nous ont permis d’identifier une variation de la durée vocalique des phonèmes / i u ai / chez les locuteurs de notre corpus en fonction de la structure morphologique et de l’environnement segmental. Cette variation s’est en revanche révélée absente pour les voyelles / e a o ɔ ɪ ɛ ʌ au ɔi /, ce qui confirme les résultats de certains travaux antérieurs. L’influence du voisement du segment consonantique suivant la voyelle sur la durée de celle-ci n’a pas pu être mise en évidence de manière catégorique. Sur le plan théorique, la question de la longueur (ou bimoraïcité) qui, pour nombre de spécialistes, constitue l’épine dorsale de la phonologie de l’anglais est au centre des préoccupations de la thèse. Bien qu’il soit souvent nié que la longueur soit pertinente dans les accents écossais, nous proposons de continuer à diviser les voyelles en deux sous-ensembles : longues et brèves. Néanmoins, la classification que nous avançons à partir de notre étude expérimentale ne correspond pas exactement aux classifications traditionnelles.},

The system includes various methods for extracting potential terms of interest from raw text, for providing guesses on the pronunciations of terms, and for comparing two strings as possible transliterations using both phonetic and temporal measures. The system works with any script in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane and is easily extended to include new modules. Given comparable corpora, such as newswire text, in a pair of languages that use different scripts, ScriptTranscriber provides an easy way to mine transliterations from the comparable texts. This is particularly useful for underresourced languages, where training data for transliteration may be lacking, and where it is thus hard to train good transliterators. ScriptTranscriber provides an open source package that allows for ready incorporation of more sophisticated modules ― e.g. a trained transliteration model for a particular language pair. ScriptTranscriber is available as part of the nltk contrib source tree at http://code.google.com/p/nltk/.},

  abstract = {This dissertation explores two learning problems in L2 phonology: (1) acquiring a new L2 distribution when both sounds exist in the L1 as allophones; (2) acquiring the same L2 distribution when neither sound has a direct L1 counterpart. Previous literature has investigated these problems separately, focusing more on the first situation than the second. To explore these scenarios, I analysed the L2 production of Spanish taps and trills, which are contrastive word-medially intervocalically, by 10 L1 Romanian and 10 French speakers. 13 native Spanish controls were also included. These language pairings were chosen because Romanian has both rhotics as allophones (albeit in free variation), with the tap being the most common, and the trill sometimes occurring word-initially, while French has neither. Data was elicited using two tasks: a sentence reading (more formal, orthography) and a picture description task (less formal, no orthography). The stimuli included nonce and real words containing word-initial and word-medial rhotics. Because a secondary objective was to provide empirical evidence and acoustic analyses for rhotics in Romanian, participants also completed similar tasks in their L1.   	The results confirm previous observations that the most common Romanian rhotic is the tap. The trill mainly appears word-initially. The L2 data showed that the tap was less difficult than the trill, with both learner groups producing taps at high rates. However, both learner groups had low trilling rates. Though the L1 Romanian group produced more trills than the L1 French group overall, when the position of trills was considered, there were no differences between groups. Specifically, both learner groups had significantly higher trilling rates word-medially than initially, corroborating previous research, and there were no group differences. Furthermore, speakers produced more of the expected rhotics in the sentence reading than in the picture description task. Overall, given the low trilling rates, these findings suggest that recategorizing L1 allophones may be just as challenging as learning a new L2 distribution that does not have L1 counterparts, though the difficulties may be due to different reasons. Finally, this study also provides acoustic data supporting previous observations regarding Romanian rhotics.},

The results were indicative of a higher rate of both assibilated/fricative rhotics and approximant rhotics in the auditory–orthographic group. In addition, there was evidence that the acoustic input modulated the orthographic effects. However, the auditory-only group produced a higher rate of postalveolar sibilants. These results will be discussed in terms of (a) the salience-enhancing effect of the grapheme {$<$}r{$>$} and (b) the overriding effect of orthography.},

Additional information is provided on WI /l/ as a singleton and in clusters. A native speaker audio-recorded and transcribed single words in a story-telling task. Results for WI rhotic clusters show an age effect consistent with previous research on European Portuguese. Singleton /l/ was in advance of /l/-clusters as expected, but the tap clusters were in advance of the /l/-clusters, possibly reflecting the velarized characteristics of the lateral. The prosodic variables word stress and word length were relevant for the WI rhotic clusters: shorter words and stressed syllables showed higher accuracy. Finally, mismatches (‘errors’) mainly reflected negative structural constraints (deletion of C2 and epenthesis) rather than segmental constraints (substitutions).},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}When speakers of two or more languages interact, they are likely to influence each other: contact leaves traces in the linguistic record, which in turn can reveal geographic areas of past human interaction and migration. However the complex, multi-dimensional nature of contact has hindered the development of a rigorous methodology for detecting its traces. Specifically, other factors may contribute to similarities between languages. Inheritance (a property is passed from an ancestor to several descendant languages), and universal preference (a property is universally preferred), may both overshadow contact signals. How can we find geographic contact areas in language data, while accounting for the confounding effects of inheritance and universal preference? We present sBayes, an algorithm for Bayesian clustering in the presence of confounding effects. The algorithm learns which similarities in a set of features are better accounted for by confounders, and which are due to contact effects. Contact areas are free to take any shape or size, but an explicit geographic prior ensures their spatial coherence. We test the clustering method on simulated data and apply it in two case studies to reveal language contact in South America and the Balkans. Our results are supported by ---mostly qualitative--- findings from previous studies. While we focus on the specific problem of language contact, the method can also be used to uncover other traces of shared history in cultural evolution, and more generally, to reveal latent spatial clusters in the presence of confounders.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This paper presents the results of acoustic and perceptual experiments involving these segments. Specifically, we probe the statistical characteristics of the /r/ vs. /rr/ contrast across prosodic positions from the perspective of both the speaker and the listener. We measure trills in 24 different Arop-Lokep words, so the resulting data are quite robust and give an excellent idea of the variation inherent in the language. A novel finding is that both lengths of trill consist of more apical contacts word-initially than intervocalically. The scope of this work is unprecedented in that no previous instrumental study has examined both initial and medial geminate trills in the same language.},

The two consonant classes are invariably opposed by degree of tongue dorsum contact and F2, but only differentiated by place of articulation when constriction location for the trill is sufficiently retracted. Trills are produced with less than three contacts and may exhibit a single contact in utterance-initial position and, less often, in /Cr, VrV/ sequences. Word-final and, to a lesser extent, preconsonantal rhotics are implemented as taps in Majorcan and Valencian, and strengthened into trills in Eastern Catalan. Moreover, there appears to be an inverse relationship between initial strengthening, and intervocalic weakening and the absence of syllable-final strengthening, for Valencian rhotics, which could be indicative of a pattern of intersegmental organization. Shortening and articulatory reduction turned out not to be necessarily related for extremely short Valencian taps, which undergo much undershoot intervocalically but are highly constricted in /Cɾ, rC/ sequences. Other research aspects such as devoicing and intergestural timing for Catalan alveolar rhotics are also investigated.},

  abstract = {This is an electropalatographic and acoustic study of the production and coarticulatory characteristics of the alveolar tap /J/ and the alveolar trill /r/ in Catalan VCV sequences. The finding that /r/ involves more closure retraction, more predorsum lowering and less apico-predorsal coupling than /J/ suggests that the two consonants are realized by means of different lingual gestures. Moreover, in comparison with the tap, the trill exerts larger and longer effects on the adjacent vowels and is less sensitive to vocalic effects. This suggests that the tongue body is more constrained for /r/ than for /J/. The finding that the lingual gesture for a consonant (/r/) overrides the lingual gesture for an adjacent vowel (/i/) when the two segments are highly constrained and antagonistic is supportive of a view that consonantal production is more precisely controlled than vowel production. The tap and the trill also differ with respect to the direction of VCV coarticulatory effects: on the one hand, in /VrV/ sequences, anticipatory consonant and vowel coarticulation is predominant; on the other, in /VJV/ sequences, vocalic coarticulation is predominantly carryover, whereas consonantal coarticulation is mainly anticipatory. These patterns of coarticulatory behavior are accounted for in terms of gestural production mechanisms and biomechanical properties of the lingual articulators. Differences in articulation and coarticulation between /r/ and /J/ suggest that the trill is not a geminate correlate of the tap.},

  abstract = {Articulatory data are provided showing that, in languages in which they have phonemic status, (alveolo)palatal consonants, dark /l/ and the trill /r/ are articulated with a single lingual gesture instead of two independent tongue front and tongue body gestures. They are therefore simple, not complex segments. It is argued that tongue body lowering and retraction for dark /l/ and the trill /r/ is associated with manner of articulation requirements and with requirements on the implementation of the darkness percept in the case of dark /l/, and that tongue body raising and fronting for (alveolo)palatals results naturally from the contraction of the genioglossus muscle. These consonant units resemble truly complex palatalized and velarized or pharyngealized dentoalveolars regarding lingual coniguration and kinematics, as well as coarticulatory efects and phonological and sound change processes. Contrary to some views, the study also contends that clear /l/ and the tap /ɾ/ are not complex segments but consonants articulated with a more or less neutral tongue body coniguration which is subject to considerable vowel coarticulation.},

For instance, allophonic variant forms have to be recognized as the same phoneme. A minimal pair identification task was used to assess how late Spanish learners of German perceive the phonological /r/-/h/ contrast. German /r/ was realized as one of three allophones ([r], [r], [ʁ]) that vary in phonetic similarity to /h/ as well as to the typical phonetic form of Spanish /r/ (i.e., [r]). Results showed that learners were very good at identifying all German variant forms ({$>$}90\% correct). However, [ʁ], which is phonetically closest to German /h/ and furthest from Spanish /r/, was identified significantly worse than [r] and [r]. Relating these results to a cross-language perception task where learners were asked to map the German allophones of /r/ and the phoneme /h/ to different L1 phonological categories further showed that those learners were best at identifying words with [ʁ] who consistently matched it to a single L1 category. Surprisingly this category did not always have to be the phonologically matching Spanish /r/. We conclude that phonological and phonetic relations between the learners' L1 and L2 are important in identifying allophones of the same L2 category.},

As we shall see, Shilluk presents a similarly complex system of suprasegmental distinctions.},

  abstract = {It is known that the mid vowel contrasts of Standard Italian distinguish few minimal pairs, may be lexically variable, and show some degree of phonological conditioning in certain varieties. As such, they are relevant to recent suggestions that phonemic contrast may be partial, gradient, or otherwise more cognitively complex than traditionally assumed. Production data and vowel height judgments from 17 speakers con rm that most have clear phonetic distinctions between higher and lower mid vowels. However, the lexical distribution of these vowels is variable, and (in some speakers) phonologically conditioned to some extent; and though phonological awareness for all speakers is broadly accurate, we also observe cases where production and speaker judgment fail to match, in part because individual speakers’ productions are variable. This suggests that the somewhat marginal status of the Italian mid vowel contrasts resides in the link between phonetic categories and individual lexical items, not in any indistinctness of the phonetic categories themselves.},

Traditionally, the A’i (speakers of A’ingae) lived in the Andean foothills, but over the past century they have migrated down the Aguarico and San Miguel rivers, founding communities at Dureno and Zábalo, where the language is most widely spoken. This migration was spurred in large part by extensive oil contamination; an issue of great concern to the Foundation for the Survival of the Cofán People (FSC) and the community at large (Cepek 2012: 103; 2018: 1–15). Another concern in the Cofán community is the decreasing use of A’ingae, which, according to               Ethnologue               (Simons \&amp; Fennig 2017), is ‘endangered’ in Ecuador and ‘severely endangered’ in Colombia as a growing emphasis on Spanish disincentivizes the younger generation from learning A’ingae.},

  abstract = {Berber (or Tamazight) is an Afro-Asiatic language spoken by an estimated 15–25 million in North Africa. It is mainly spoken in Morocco, Algeria, and by the Touareg population in Niger and Mali. Berber is also a native language of populations living in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, though their numbers are less significant. Large Berber communities also live in Diasporas mainly in France, Spain, Holland, and Belgium. Three varieties of Berber are spoken in Morocco: Tarifit, spoken in northern Morocco, Tamazight, spoken in the Middle-Atlas, and Tashlhiyt, spoken in southern Morocco. Tashlhiyt, the variety presented here, is sufficiently homogeneous for all native speakers, who number an estimated 7–9 million, to communicate without difficulties (Stroomer 2008). There is nonetheless a measure of sub-dialectal variation, which affects mainly the way some stop consonants are produced. Three subsystems, corresponding roughly to three distinct geographical locations, can be identified: the ‘occlusive’ subsystem spoken in Agadir and its suburbs, the ‘fricative’ subsystem spoken mainly in the High-Atlas area, which spirantizes noncoronal obstruents /               b               k               g               / in some contexts, and the ‘sibilant’ subsystem spoken in the Anti-Atlas area, where /               t               / and /               d               / are realized in some contexts as [               s               ] and [               z               ], respectively (Boukous 1994). This study is based on the speech of Tashlhiyt speakers who originate from Agadir. The text of ‘The North Wind and the Sun’ was read by a 27-year-old female speaker.},

Many speakers are also fluent in Bislama (an English-lexifier creole spoken in Vanuatu), one of three official languages. A dialect of Tamambo spoken on the eastern half of the island is now almost extinct, the main phonetic differences from the western dialect being the lack of prenasalized stops and labialized consonants, and the short articulation of vowels. Previous phonetic work on Tamambo is limited to a descriptive grammar of the language (Jauncey 1997).},

  abstract = {This article analyzes the assibilation of /r/ among young people in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, in light of previous research on women's speech in language change. It is demonstrated that assibilation, an innovation known to have first appeared in the speech of women of the middle and upper social echelons, is closely associated with sex, sociocultural level, and attitude toward traditional male and female roles. These attitudes are suggested as a factor that plays an important role in the dynamics of the change, showing opposite effects among young men and women. That is, young men with traditional attitudes assibilate least, whereas young women with traditional attitudes assibilate most frequently. Parallels between this study and one of a similar innovation in Argentinian Spanish suggest a generalized pattern of change in which variables introduced by women of the middle and upper social echelons become markers of gender display in the lower classes, where they grow to be favored by women and avoided by men. The discovery of the role of attitude toward traditional sex roles in this pattern of change is unique to the present study.},

Understanding how the posterior portions of the tongue move is vital for understanding speech motor control, especially with regard to speech development. This study used ultrasound imaging of /r/ productions by adult native speakers of Spanish to characterize the contribution of the posterior portion of the tongue to effective production of the sound. The results show that beyond raising the anterior portion of the tongue for trilling, Spanish speakers also retract the back part of their tongue (i.e., the tongue root). This movement resembles that seen for the production of the rhotic English approximant (ɹ). Clinical implications are discussed.},

Data were collected by an online or printed survey divided in three parts: (1) demographic data and vocal health aspects; (2) self-assessment of sleep and vocal quality, and the influence that sleep has on voice; and (3) sleep and voice self-assessment inventories—the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Voice Handicap Index reduced version (VHI-10). A total of 862 people were included (493 women, 369 men), with a mean age of 32 years old (maximum age of 79 and minimum age of 18 years old). Results. The perception of the influence that sleep has on voice showed a difference (P {$<$} 0.050) between measures of sleep quality and vocal self-assessment. There were higher scores on the ESS, PSQI, and VHI-10 protocols if sleep and vocal self-assessment were poor. The results indicate that the greater the effect that sleep has on voice, the greater the perceived voice handicap. The aspects that influence a voice handicap are vocal self-assessment, ESS total score, and self-assessment of the influence that sleep has on voice. The absence of daytime sleepiness is a protective factor (odds ratio [OR] {$>$} 1) against perceived voice handicap; the presence of daytime sleepiness is a damaging factor (OR {$<$} 1). Conclusions. Sleep quality influences voice. Perceived poor sleep quality is related to perceived poor vocal quality. Individuals with a voice handicap observe a greater influence of sleep on voice than those without.},

  abstract = {Italian is spoken in Italy, in parts of Switzerland and Croatia, and in diaspora communities across the world. The standard language as spoken in Italy has three main regional varieties: Northern, Central and Southern. But contemporary ‘mainstream Italian’ – not following the standard in all respects – appears to be a variety under construction by speakers wishing to give themselves a national appeal, a process driven by the media and by workplace mobility. Our speaker is representative of this group. She is a woman in her thirties who was brought up in a middle-class household in Rome, and has travelled extensively in Italy and abroad. She aims at a cultivated accent with no strong regional features, sometimes called a ‘RAI’ accent (RAI /rai/ is the national broadcaster). The style she uses is a somewhat coloured ‘storytelling’ style.},

It is spoken by about 21,000 speakers (see Rojas-Berscia 2013) in the provinces of Alto Amazonas and Datem del Marañón in the region of Loreto and in the northern part of the region of San Martín, being one of the most vital languages in the country (see Figure 1).               2               Although Shawi groups in the Upper Amazon were contacted by Jesuit missionaries during colonial times, the maintenance of their customs and language is striking. To date, most Shawi children are monolingual and have their first contact with Spanish at school. Yet, due to globalisation and the construction of highways by the Peruvian government, many Shawi villages are progressively westernising. This may result in the imminent loss of their indigenous culture and language.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on the emergence of consonantal place and manner feature categories in the speech of first language learners. Starting with an overview of current representational approaches to phonology, we take the position that only models that allow for the emergence of phonological categories at all levels of phonological representation (from sub-segmental properties of speech sounds all the way to word forms represented within the child’s lexicon) can account for the data. We begin with a cross-linguistic survey of the acquisition of rhotic consonants. We show that the types of substitutions affecting different rhotics cross-linguistically can be predicted from two main observations: the phonetic characteristics of these rhotics and the larger system of categories displayed by each language. We then turn to a peculiar pattern of labial substitution for coronal continuants in the speech of a German learner. Building on previous literature on the topic, we attribute the emergence of this pattern to distributional properties of the child’s developing lexicon. Together, these observations suggest that our understanding of phonological emergence must involve a consideration of multiple, potentially interacting levels of phonetic and phonological representation.},

The basic material is taken from three longitudinal studies regarding three Latvian-learning (monolingual) children; additional observations were made of five other children. In spite of the fact that Latvian is rich in consonantal clusters, all children had difficulties in mastering them correctly: they tried to avoid them by omission of one or two consonants or by replacing them with other sounds. Even hypercorrect substitutions appeared. Medial clusters occurred much earlier than clusters in other positions, and final clusters several months before initial clusters. Similar observations in Czech children learning their mother-tongue point to some universal character of this phenomenon since consonantal clusters are absent in many world languages or are used in special positions, and they are among the first features which disappear in aphasia.},

Using historic French data on rhotics (‘‘r-like sounds”), productive and perceptual evaluative matrices are proposed to account for output variability, including a formalization of ranked output. If ad hoc segmental constraints are proscribed, as it is argued, the ultimate selection of one rhotic over another cannot be fully explained without recourse to knowledge units deriving from extra-grammatical factors, in this instance social forces. Proposals for the reconciliation of constraint-based models with attested data include the reintroduction of parochial rules and the admission of learned, non-universal constraints.},

It further concludes that /ʎ/ is for all intents and purposes extinct, and that the stigmatized allophones of /f/ and /l/, as well as a non-stigmatized allophone of /b/, have been largely abandoned.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the argument-coding system of Mosetenan, a small language family spoken in the Bolivian Amazon. While there is no case marking on nouns, all coding of arguments is found in the cross-reference ending of verbs. Intransitive verbs are marked for the gender of their subjects, except for the first-person plural inclusive, which has a marker, -ja’, that does not indicate the gender of the subject. Transitive cross-referencing is more complicated. It is a layered system that combines the grammatical relation of the participant (S, A, or O) with the person (1, 2, 3) and number (singular and plural). Again, the forms of first-person plural inclusive subjects are unique. The second most important forms are third-person objects, which appear before any of the speech-act participants (SAP). I analyze the Mosetenan system, discussing how language contact can shape the general outline of an argument-coding system by the introduction of a new category such as an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first-person plural.},

The objective of this study was to determine whether Egyptian Cairene /r/ was a trill or a tap and, if both forms were present, whether they were affected by word position or adjacent vowels/consonants. The information obtained was intended to improve correction of /r/ in faulty articulation. Spectrographic analysis was done for 50 Cairene subjects, who produced /r/ in different word positions in carrier phrases.

  abstract = {A major hurdle in data-driven research on typology is having sufficient data in many languages to draw meaningful conclusions. We present VoxClamantis V1.0, the first largescale corpus for phonetic typology, with aligned segments and estimated phonemelevel labels in 690 readings spanning 635 languages, along with acoustic-phonetic measures of vowels and sibilants. Access to such data can greatly facilitate investigation of phonetic typology at a large scale and across many languages. However, it is nontrivial and computationally intensive to obtain such alignments for hundreds of languages, many of which have few to no resources presently available. We describe the methodology to create our corpus, discuss caveats with current methods and their impact on the utility of this data, and illustrate possible research directions through a series of case studies on the 48 highest-quality readings. Our corpus and scripts are publicly available for non-commercial use at https:// voxclamantisproject.github.io.},

More recent studies Stolarski 2011; Savu 2011, 2012 consider and argue that the tap is actually comprised of two vowel-like elements flanking this small constriction. After presenting the argument leading to this conclusion and briefly discussing the quality of the tap\&rsquo;s vocoids as shown through phonetic experiments, I approach the implications of this sound having the aforementioned structure. Specifically, I address the consequences for the status of syllabic /r/ in Macedonian and the different perception of /CɨrC/ sequences by speakers of Romanian and Slavic languages with syllabic /r/. In addition to this, I show how this structure of the tap suggests a possible phonetic account for vowel-rhotic metathesis between consonants as the migration of the constriction on a vocalic continuum provided by the tap and the full vowel.},

Overall brain size is associated with some key behavioral features relevant to language, including complexity of the social environment and the degree of conceptual complexity. Prefrontal cortical and temporal lobe areas relevant to language appear to have increased disproportionately. Areas relevant to language production and perception have changed less dramatically. The extent to which these changes were a consequence specifically of language versus other behavioral adaptations is a good question, but the process may best be viewed as a complex adaptive system, whereby cultural learning interacts with biology iteratively over time to produce language. Overall, language appears to have adapted to the human brain more so than the reverse.},

In particular, information-theoretic and psycholinguistic considerations suggest that this may include maximizing the uniformity of information density in an utterance. We investigate this possibility in the context of syntactic reduction, where the speaker has the option of either marking a higher-order unit (a phrase) with an extra word, or leaving it unmarked. We demonstrate that speakers are more likely to reduce less information-dense phrases. In a second step, we combine a stochastic model of structured utterance production with a logistic-regression model of syntactic reduction to study which types of cues speakers employ when estimating the predictability of upcoming elements. We demonstrate that the trend toward predictability-sensitive syntactic reduction (Jaeger, 2006) is robust in the face of a wide variety of control variables, and present evidence that speakers use both surface and structural cues for predictability estimation.},

Kano Hausa is the variety most commonly heard on national and regional radio and television broadcasts in Nigeria as well as most international broadcasting, such as the BBC, Deutsche Welle, Radio Moscow, and Voice of America. Kano Hausa is therefore familiar throughout the Hausa speaking areas of Nigeria as well as Hausa speaking communities in Niger, Ghana, and other areas outside northern Nigeria. Hausa has a standard orthography, in use since the 1930's and also based on the Kano variety. It is familiar to all Hausa speakers literate in the Romanized orthography. (Many Hausas are also literate in Arabic orthography, a variety of which has been used to write Hausa, probably for several centuries. The Arabic orthography for Hausa is less standardized than the Roman orthography and has little formally published literature.)},

Now more than 20 years old, CAT has made many positive contributions, theoretical and empirical, to the naturalization of the social sciences. In consequence of this growing impact, CAT has, in recent years, been the subject of critical discussion. Here, we review and respond to these critiques. In so doing, we also provide a clear and concise introduction to CAT. We give clear characterizations of CAT's key theoretical notions, and we outline how these notions are derived from consideration of the natural character of cultural phenomena (Box ). This naturalistic quality distinguishes CAT from other evolutionary approaches to culture.},

Latin /r/ mirrored the behaviour of Latin /l/ up to the first century BC: /l/ was dark and /r/ was clear in codas, and /r/ was dark and /l/ was underspecified for tongue body position in onsets. Darkness in /r/ was partly implemented through the selection of r-type: dark onset approximant and clear coda tap. Later, coda /r/ became an approximant like onset /r/, and subsequently both became trills, resulting in the erosion of the positional contrast and the liquid polarity effect.},

  abstract = {The close relationship between language variation and the nature of social ties among people has been the focus of long-standing commentary in linguistics. A central puzzle in this relationship is the seeming contradiction between two bodies of evidence: automatic, mechanistic diffusion of linguistic forms through social networks and ideologically mediated choice in uptake of forms. Nearly a century of research has revealed that certain types of network structure facilitate the diffusion of linguistic innovation, but these network structures are always anchored in temporally specific and ideologically mediated cultural norms—for instance, norms of gender, class, and ethnicity. Furthermore, not all linguistic variables diffuse in the same way through these structures; social indexicality has a mediating effect. We review prevailing methodologies, theories, and conclusions of this body of work and look ahead to emerging technological advances and more integrated theoretical approaches.},

In order to explore these two theories, a behavioral task was designed exploiting the absence of native words in Spanish containing a final trill onset that carry antepenultimat stress. The geminate view of Spanish rhotics argues that this pattern is absent because it is prohibited by the synchronic phonological grammar, while two-phoneme approaches consider it a diachronie gap. A nonword naming task tested the representation of this nonextant word shape by comparing trisyllabi nonce forms containing trills to other controlled sequences in theoretically banned (antepenultimate) and permitted (penultimate) stress conditions. The results of the experiment are interpreted as evidence against a geminate analysis of Spanish taps and trills. The data also suggest gradience in phonemic categorization and are considered within an emergent conception of the lexicon.},

A total of eight subjects were tested and two transcribers were subsequently selected and trained for narrow phonetic transcription by consensus (Shriberg,Kwiatkowskiand Hoffmann, 1984). Discussion of the quantitative data and anecdotal observations during both phases of the study focuseson applied implications of a three-factor view of the competent transcriber.},

  abstract = {The complexity of an inflection class system can be defined as the average extent to which elements in the system inhibit motivated inferences about the realization of lexemes’ paradigm cells. Research shows that systems tend to exhibit relatively low complexity in this sense. However, relatively little work has explored how structural and distributional aspects of the inflectional system produce this outcome. In this paper we use the tools of information theory to do so. We explore a set of nine languages that have robust inflection class systems: Palantla Chinantec, French, Modern Greek, Icelandic, Kadiwe´u, Nuer, Russian, Seri, and Vo˜ro. The data show that the extent to which implicative paradigmatic structure does work to minimize the complexity of the system differs significantly. In fact, the nine languages fall into three graph types based on their implicative structure. Moreover, low type frequency classes disproportionately contribute to the complexity of inflectional systems, but we hypothesize that their freedom to detract in this way may depend on the extent to which implicative structure is systemically important. We thus propose that the amount of ‘work’ done by implicative relations in structuring inflection classes should be considered a typological parameter.},

  abstract = {Niche construction theory is a relatively new approach in evolutionary biology that seeks to integrate an ecological dimension into the Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection. It is regarded by many evolutionary biologists as providing a significant revision of the Neo-Darwinian modern synthesis that unified Darwin’s theory of natural and sexual selection with 20th century population genetics. Niche construction theory has been invoked as a processual mediator of social cognitive evolution and of the emergence and evolution of language. I argue that language itself can be considered as a biocultural niche and evolutionary artifact. I provide both a general analysis of the cognitive and semiotic status of artifacts, and a formal analysis of language as a social and semiotic institution, based upon a distinction between the fundamental semiotic relations of “counting as” and “standing for.” I explore the consequences for theories of language and language learning of viewing language as a biocultural niche. I suggest that not only do niches mediate organism-organism interactions, but also that organisms mediate niche-niche interactions in ways that affect evolutionary processes, with the evolution of human infancy and childhood as a key example. I argue that language as a social and semiotic system is not only grounded in embodied engagements with the material and social-interactional world, but also grounds a subclass of artifacts of particular significance in the cultural history of human cognition. Symbolic cognitive artifacts materially and semiotically mediate human cognition, and are not merely informational repositories, but co-agentively constitutive of culturally and historically emergent cognitive domains. I provide examples of the constitutive cognitive role of symbolic cognitive artifacts drawn from my research with my colleagues on cultural and linguistic conceptualizations of time, and their cultural variability. I conclude by reflecting on the philosophical and social implications of understanding artifacts co-agentively.},

  abstract = {This paper brings together typological and sociolinguistic approaches to language variation. Its main aim is to evaluate the relative effect of language internal and external factors on the number of cases in the world’s languages. I model word order as a language internal predictor; it is well-known that, for instance, languages with verb-final word order (that is, languages in which both nominal arguments precede the main lexical verb) tend to develop complex case systems more often than languages with SVO word order do. I model population size and the proportion of second language speakers in the speech community as sociolinguistic predictors; these factors have been suggested recently to influence the distribution of the number of cases in the world’s languages. Modelling the data with generalized linear mixed effects modelling suggests an interaction between the number of cases, word order, and the proportion of second language speakers on the one hand, and between the number of cases, word order, and population size, on the other. This kind of complex interactions have not been previously reported in typological research wherefore they call for more complex explanations than previously suggested for cross-linguistic variation.},

We present experimental evidence showing that humans learn words effectively using cross-situational learning, even at high levels of referential uncertainty. Both overall success rates and the time taken to learn words are affected by the degree of referential uncertainty, with greater referential uncertainty leading to less reliable, slower learning. Words are also learned less successfully and more slowly if they are presented interleaved with occurrences of other words, although this effect is relatively weak. We present additional analyses of participants’ trial-by-trial behavior showing that participants make use of various cross-situational learning strategies, depending on the difficulty of the word-learning task. When referential uncertainty is low, participants generally apply a rigorous eliminative approach to cross-situational learning. When referential uncertainty is high, or exposures to different words are interleaved, participants apply a frequentist approximation to this eliminative approach. We further suggest that these two ways of exploiting cross-situational information reside on a continuum of learning strategies, underpinned by a single simple associative learning mechanism.},

  abstract = {Cocos Malay, hereafter called Cocos, is referred to in the               Ethnologue               with the ISO code of ‘coa’. The               Ethnologue               considers Cocos to be a Malay-based Creole along with several other Malay-based creoles (Lewis 2009). Cocos is spoken in Australia and in Malaysia. In Australia, it is spoken on the islands of Cocos and Christmas with a total combined population of about 700 speakers on those two islands. In Malaysia, Cocos speakers are found primarily in the eastern and southeastern coastal districts of Sabah (Kunak, Semporna, Lahad Datu and Tawau). In early 2013, the               Ethnologue               listed the population of Cocos speakers in Malaysia as 4,000 and decreasing. The               Ethnologue               also stated that the total number of Cocos speakers in all places around the world is 5,000. However, both of these statements in the               Ethnologue               are not correct. The Cocos population in Malaysia is increasing, not decreasing, and the total worldwide population of Cocos speakers is much larger than the               Ethnologue               estimate. The 1970 population estimate for Cocos speakers in Malaysia was 2,731 (Moody 1984: 93, 100). But the 2012 population estimate for Cocos speakers worldwide is 22,400, with most Cocos speakers living in Sabah, Malaysia. Our study focused exclusively on Cocos speakers in Malaysia. Some Cocos speakers interviewed in our study claimed that their ancestors originated from the island of Cocos (also known as Keeling), southwest of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean. Others claimed that their ancestors originally inhabited the Indonesian islands of the Malay Archipelaɡo and subsequently migrated to Cocos Island and then to Sabah. Two historical accounts of the Cocos can be found in Nanis (2011) and Subiah, Rabika \& Kabul (1981).},

This is because these sounds are usually attributed to certain peculiar articulatory, acoustic, auditive and other characteristics. In addition, the functions they perform in phonological systems are, relatively frequently, quite complex. Spanish, in this aspect, turns out to be a specific language. Indeed, in addition to having two consonants of this type, it is a language where these sounds work in such a way as to provoke numerous descriptive, methodological and other problems. Hence, according to our perspective, Spanish can serve as a starting point for contrastive works within the framework of the rhotic consonants. For this reason, in this contribution our aim is to concisely present certain problems linked to the Spanish rhotic consonants indicating, at the same time, the features that differentiate them from the sounds that work in other languages that we have selected for this work.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates the role of phonetic biases and systemic effects in the  actuation of sound change through computer simulations and experimental  methods. Phonetic biases are physiological and psychoacoustic constraints on  speech. One example is vowel undershoot: vowels sometimes fail to reach their  phonetic targets due to limitations on the speed of the articulators. Phonetic biases  are often paralleled by phonological patterns. For instance, many languages  exhibit vowel reduction, a phonologised version of undershoot. To account for  these parallels, a number of researchers have proposed that phonetic biases are  the causal drive behind sound change. Although this proposal seems to solve  the problem of actuation, its success is only apparent: while it might be able  to explain situations where sound change occurs, it cannot easily explain the  lack of sound change, that is, stasis. Since stability in sound systems seems to  be the rule rather than the exception, the bias-based approach cannot provide  an adequate account of their diachronic development on its own.  The problem of bias-based accounts stems from their focus on changes affecting  individual sound categories, and their neglect of system-wide interactions.  The factors that affect speech production and perception define an adaptive  landscape. The development of sound systems follows the topology of this landscape.  When only a single category is investigated, it is easy to take an overly  simplistic view of this landscape, and assume that phonetic biases are the only  relevant factor. It is natural that the predicted outcomes will be simple and deterministic  if such an approach is adopted. However, when we look at an entire  sound system, other pressures such as contrast maintenance also become relevant,  and the range of possible outcomes is much more diverse. Phonetic biases  can still skew the adaptive landscape towards themselves, making phonetically  natural outcomes more likely. However, their effects will often be countered by  other pressures, which means that they will not be satisfied in every case.  Sound systems move towards peaks in the adaptive landscape, or local  optima, where the different pressures balance each other out. As a result, the  system-based approach predicts stability. This stability can be broken by changes  in the pressures that define the adaptive landscape. For instance, an increase or  a decrease in functional load or a change in lexical distributions can create a  situation where the sound system is knocked out of an equilibrium and starts  evolving towards a new stable state. In essence, the adaptive landscape can  create a moving target for the sound system. This ensures that both stability  and change are observed. Therefore, this account makes realistic predictions  with respect to the actuation problem.  This argument is developed through a series of computer simulations that  follow changes in artificial sound systems. All of these simulations are based on  four theoretical assumptions: (i) speech production and perception are based  on probabilistic category representations; (ii) these category representations  are subject to continuous update throughout the lifetime of an individual; (iii)  speech production and perception are affected by low-level universal phonetic  biases; and (iv) category update is inhibited in cases where too many ambiguous  tokens are produced due to category overlap. Special care is taken to  anchor each of these assumptions in empirical results from a variety of fields  including phonetics, sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics. Moreover, in order  to show that the results described above follow directly from these theoretical  assumptions and not other aspects of these models, the thesis demonstrates  that exemplar and prototype models produce the same dynamics with respect  to the observations above, and that the number of speakers in the model also  does not have a significant influence on the outcomes.  Much of the thesis focuses on rather abstract properties of simulated systems,  which are difficult to test in a systematic way. The last chapter complements  this by presenting a concrete example, which shows how the simulations can  be linked to empirical data. Specifically, I look at the effect of lexical factors on  the strength of contextual effects in sound categories, using the example of the  voicing effect, whereby vowels are longer before voiced obstruents than they  are before voiceless ones. The simulations implemented in this chapter predict  a larger effect in cases where a given vowel category occurs equally frequently  in voiced and voiceless environments, and a smaller difference where one of the  environments dominates the lexical distribution of the vowel. This prediction is  borne out in a small cross-linguistic production experiment looking at voicingconditioned  vowel length patterns in French, Hungarian and English. Although  this is only one of many predictions that fall out of the theory of sound change  developed in this thesis, the success of this experiment is a strong indication  that the research questions it brings into focus are worth investigating.},

Our initial acoustic analysis suggests that /r/ was weakening across the board based on an increase in F3. However, an auditory analysis of the same data finds no significant changes. An acoustic analysis of the same speakers’ vowels reveals that the shift in F3 is not unique to /r/. It reflects a change in voice quality, which we link to velarisation using Vocal Profile Analysis. We then reanalyse the acoustic /r/ data controlling for voice quality, and find only moderate changes that are restricted to females. These findings provide new evidence for diachronic changes in voice quality, contribute to our understanding of the development of /r/ in Glasgow English, and highlight the importance of investigating speech sounds in their broader context using multiple methodologies.},

  abstract = {A hundred years from now a large number of presently spoken languages will no longer be viable means of communication, and the distinctive sounds that they contain will have disappeared. Of the nearly seven thousand languages in the world listed by Grimes (1992), about ten per cent are spoken by around a thousand people or less. As the speakers of these languages grow old, and their children go to schools in which the main languages of the country predominate, phoneticians will no longer have access to the wide variety of sounds currently in use. Toda, a language spoken by about a thousand speakers in the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India, has some unusual sounds that will probably not exist in our great grandchildren's times. Among them are the six trills which this paper will describe. Tongue tip trills occur in about one third of the world's languages (Maddieson 1984). None of the languages in Maddieson's sample has two contrasting apical trills without secondary articulations, although they have been reported in Malayalam (Ladefoged 1971). To the best of our knowledge only Toda has three contrasting trills; and almost certainly no other language has surface contrasts between palatalized and non-palatalized versions of three lingual trills. Toda is a rich source for trill-seeking phoneticians.},

In our paper, we address this question and examine how speakers organize into consistent groups of allophones the array of /r/-variants that are used in South-Tyrol Italian (STI). In addition, we discuss that this process of grouping is based on two intertwining sources of variation: the linguistic source and the socio-indexical source. We argue that the indexical dimension is not disconnected from the linguistic one, but it contributes in an essential way to its structuring.Our investigation is based on a sample of two thousand tokens of /r/. These occurrences are extracted from a corpus that includes the (semi)spontaneous productions of 14 Italian-German bilingual speakers. The analysis concerns the identification of possible relationships among the allophones with respect to (a) distributional, (b) stylistic and (c) biographical factors. Data are analyzed using a multivariate exploratory technique, namely the multiple correspondence analysis approach. The results clearly show how the aggregation of indexical and linguistic factors determines the emergence of two different allophonic subsystems, that is the Italian of Italian-dominant speakers (STI-i) and the Italian of German-dominant speakers (STI-d).},

Rather than approaching the data with a specific hypothesis in mind, I approach the data with a set of methods that analyze the temporal relationship between two behaviors and apply the methods to every single possible pair of behaviors. Rather than using the data to test hypotheses, I am using it to formulate them.    The methods used in this dissertation examine covariation between behaviors (how much do two behaviors overlap with each other, and is this more or less likely than we would expect, given a random distribution of the two behaviors), the sequential patterns of behaviors (the multimodal n-grams of behaviors that are most strongly associated), and the frequency distribution of behavior boundaries (the timing of behavior onsets and offsets near other behavior onsets and offsets).    The analyses examine all possible pairs of behaviors from four modalities (head gesture, manual gesture, eye-gaze, and speech), as well as looking within and across roles of speaker and listener. A list of testable hypotheses is given, based on the findings in the data.},

Several papers also include comparisons with singleton rhotics and/or /l/ as a singleton or in clusters. The studies are part of a larger investigation that uses similar methodologies across languages in order to enhance crosslinguistic comparability (Bernhardt and Stemberger, 2012, 2015). Participants for the current studies were monolingual preschoolers with typical or protracted phonological development who speak one of the following languages: Germanic (Icelandic/Swedish); Romance (Portuguese/Spanish); Slavic (Bulgarian/Slovenian) and Finno-Ugric (Hungarian). This introductory paper describes characteristics of taps/trills and general methodology across the studies, concluding with predicted patterns of acquisition. The seven papers that follow are in a sense the ‘results’ for this introduction. A concluding paper discusses major findings and their implications for theory, research and clinical practice.},

This paper investigates the impact of pre-aspiration on the perception and production of contrastive quantity, e.g., {$<$}em{$>$}fato{$<$}/em{$>$} ‘fate’ vs. fatto ‘done’. It tests the hypothesis that synchronic variability involving pre-aspiration, together with concomitant stop closure shortening, may be setting in motion a sound change in Italian ultimately leading to de-gemination, i.e., /pː\,tː\,kː\,/\,\&gt;\,[\textsuperscript{h}p\,\textsuperscript{h}t\,\textsuperscript{h}k]\,\&gt;\,/p\,t\,k/. The proposed sound change would be perceptually driven (Ohala 1981, 1993) and comes about via listener association of pre-aspiration with the preceding vowel rather than the oral closure. The hypothesis is only partially supported by the experimental results. Perception data show that Italians perceive pre-aspirated stops as shorter than plain stops of analogous overall duration. However, production data show that pre-aspiration in Italian does not in fact involve concomitant oral closure shortening.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

In this paper, a highly mobile and low-cost method is proposed. By connecting low impedance earbuds into a microphone jack of a recording device and placing one earbud immediately below one nostril while keeping the other earbud by the mouth, it is possible to capture the relative intensity of sound exiting the nasal and oral cavities. The two channels can then be normalized to assess the relative prominence of nasality and orality in a given speech sound. This method can not only be used to establish whether nasality is present in a speech signal, but it can also provide information about the timing and duration of nasal gestures. As such, it is an ideal tool for collecting high-quality nasality data in the field.},

Categorization of each child’s system according to an implicational hierarchy was successful for nine of the ten children when phonetic inventories were considered. In addition, a phonemic inventory based on Dinnsen et al.’s phonetic inventory captured the system of phonological contrasts used by eight of the ten children. The patterns of the children who did not match the hierarchy were considered deviant rather than delayed. The ability of the hierarchy to predict the route of development in this group of children was also examined. The hierarchies (both phonetic and phonemic) successfully predicted the route of change in these cases. Implications for the use of an implicational hierarchy in phonological assessment and treatment are discussed. Further research on featurebased phonological development, in both typically-developing and disordered phonological systems is required.},

  abstract = {The human tongue has a complex architecture, consistent with its complex roles in eating, speaking and breathing. Tongue muscle architecture has been depicted in drawings and photographs, but not quantified volumetrically. This paper aims to fill that gap by measuring the muscle architecture of the tongue for 14 people captured in high-resolution 3D MRI volumes. The results show the structure, relationships and variability among the muscles, as well as the effects of age, gender and weight on muscle volume. Since the tongue consists of partially interdigitated muscles, we consider the muscle volumes in two ways. The functional muscle volume encompasses the region of the tongue served by the muscle. The structural volume halves the volume of the muscle in regions where it interdigitates with other muscles. Results show similarity of scaling across subjects, and speculate on functional effects of the anatomical structure.},

The phonology is notable for the large number of geminate and pre-glottalised consonant sequences, while the morphology is characterised by highly productive affixation and pervasive encliticisation of pronominal and aspectual elements. The language has a literary tradition including detailed local histories (Cummings 2002), and over the centuries has been represented orthographically in many ways: with two indigenous Indic or aksara-based scripts, a system based on Arabic script, and a variety of Romanised conventions. From at least the early 18th century Macassan sailors travelled regularly to northern Australia to collect and process trepang or sea cucumber (Macknight 1976), and many loanwords passed into Aboriginal languages of the northern part of Australia (Evans 1992, 1997).},

It is perhaps more accurately conceived of as a dialect chain, whereby a dialect such as Pitjantjatjara is mutually intelligible with its neighbours Ngaanyatjatjarra and Yankunytjatjara, but not with dialects more distant than these, such as Kukatja and Manyjilyjarra.},

We present tongue contours for stop, nasal and lateral productions of each of these four coronal places – /t̪ t ʈ c/, /n̪ n ɳ ɲ/ and / ̪l l ɭ ʎ/ – as well as for the two contrastive rhotics of Arrernte, the alveolar trill /r/ and the retroflex glide /ɻ/. Results show that the palatal is characterized by a high and front tongue position, and the dental is characterized by a relatively low and flat tongue in the mid-to-front portion. Consistent with previous studies, the alveolar and the retroflex are difficult to discriminate, and potential differences are discussed. The rhotics are characterized by a low front portion of the tongue, and a retracted back portion of the tongue. The front portion of the tongue is lower for the alveolar trill than for the retroflex glide; and for most speakers, the back of the tongue is more retracted for the trill than for the glide. The back of the tongue is more retracted for the rhotics than for the corresponding stops and nasals, although there is evidence this part of the tongue patterns similarly for the laterals and the rhotics. It is suggested that this posterior constriction for the various liquid sounds arises from the interaction between bio-mechanical properties of the tongue and manner of articulation requirements.},

  abstract = {Auditory roughness elicits aversion, and higher activation in cerebral areas involved in threat processing, but its link with defensive behavior is unknown. Defensive behaviors are triggered by intrusions into the space immediately surrounding the body, called peripersonal space (PPS). Integrating multisensory information in PPS is crucial to assure the protection of the body. Here, we assessed the behavioral effects of roughness on auditory-tactile integration, which reflects the monitoring of this multisensory region of space. Healthy human participants had to detect as fast as possible a tactile stimulation delivered on their hand while an irrelevant sound was approaching them from the rear hemifield. The sound was either a simple harmonic sound or a rough sound, processed through binaural rendering so that the virtual sound source was looming towards participants. The rough sound speeded tactile reaction times at a farther distance from the body than the non-rough sound. This indicates that PPS, as estimated here via auditory-tactile integration, is sensitive to auditory roughness. Auditory roughness modifies the behavioral relevance of simple auditory events in relation to the body. Even without emotional or social contextual information, auditory roughness constitutes an innate threat cue that elicits defensive responses.},

  abstract = {A detailed analysis of the phonetic structures of Aleut, a moribund language spoken in Alaska, shows how much general phonetic information can be gathered from the investigation of an endangered language. Aleut has an unusual distribution of consonants, with varying functional loads. There are no bilabial stops. Among alveolar, velar and uvular stops, VOT is shorter for alveolar than for velar or uvular stops, but, despite current general phonetic theories, there is no difference in VOT between velar and uvular stops. VOT is also longer before long vowels than before short vowels. Uvular consonants have a significant effect on the formants of following high vowels. There are three vowels and a vowel length contrast. Again, despite previous general phonetic predictions concerning languages with vowel-length contrasts, length plays a role in characterizing stress. Contrastive ratios are maintained between short and long vowels and stressed syllables are longer. Analyses of intonation show that each content word has a peak at its beginning and a trough at its end. Word contours combine with sentence downtrends to form sentence contours of cascading F 0, each word a step in the cascade. But, unlike the situation in other languages, yes/no questions have the same intonation contours as declarative sentences. Phonetic descriptions and measurements of general theoretical interest include C and V inventories, VOT measurements for coronal, velar and uvular stops, vowel-quality plots, vowel-duration measurements, question and declarative pitch tracks, pitch-track smoothing, and question vs. declarative sentence pitch medians.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the developmental patterns of acquisition of wordinitial (WI) /r/-clusters in children speaking Hungarian, typically developing (TD) or with protracted phonological development (PPD). Comparison data were also analysed for WI singleton /r/ and /l/. Participants were 191 children (aged 3;0–5;11) divided into three age groups (3, 4, 5 years), and further subdivided into TD and PPD subgroups on the basis of Whole Word Match scores (WWM). Acoustic analyses of perceptually accurate clusters were conducted to investigate epenthesis. Findings revealed that (1) both stop-/r/ clusters and singleton /r/ were mastered at age 5 by TD children, but not by children with PPD; (2) /l/ was mastered earlier than /r/; (3) mismatch types for clusters varied by age, with more C2 Deletion than C2 substitution at younger ages, and (4) schwa epenthesis durations were longer than, or equal to, those documented for adults.},

Bradley (1997) places Sumi (referred to as Sema), among the ‘Southern Naga’ languages, which include Angami (also known as Tenyidie) and Ao, in contrast to the ‘Northern Naga’ languages such as Konyak and Nocte. Burling (2003) offers a more conservative classification, placing Sumi (referred to as Simi) in an ‘Angami-Pochuri’ group containing Angami, Chakhesang (Chokri and Kheza) and Mao. Four main dialects of Sumi have been identified: the Western dialect, the Eastern dialect, the Chizolimi dialect, and the Central dialect. The Central dialect is the standard dialect used in published works of Sumi (Sreedhar 1976: 4–5).},

  abstract = {Phonological theories commonly analyze speech utterances as composed of hierarchically organized units, such as features/gestures, segments, moras, and syllables, but it is not well understood why this hierarchical organization is observed. Moreover, current phonological theories and speech production models fail to explain cross-linguistic and developmental variation in the organization of units. This paper presents the selectioncoordination theory of speech production, which attempts to unify our understanding of developmental and crosslinguistic variation in phonological structure. The theory holds that hierarchical organization emerges from a recurring trend in speech development whereby children acquire coordinative regimes of control over articulatory gestures that were previously competitively selected. In this framework, segments, moras, and syllables are understood as differently-sized instantiations of the same type of motor planning unit, and cross-linguistic and developmental phonological patterns are derived from distinguishing competitive and coordinative regimes of articulatory control. Evidence for the theory is drawn from research in motor control, speech development, and phonological and phonetic patterns in speech.},

Speech elicitation was conducted by a picturenaming task in which target phoneme was represented in initial, medial, final and syllabic position. The results show that the alveolar trill should be developed by the age of six after an intensive period of development at the age of five. Omissions do not occur in the speech of three year olds and are not typical rendition for that age; substitutions should be considered developmental by the age of 4;6 and distortions by the age of 6;0.},

This assumption has been challenged by research in linguistic typology and language evolution, but questions of language learning and use have largely been left aside. Here we review recent work on Danish that provides new insights into these questions. Unlike closely related languages, Danish has an unusually reduced phonetic structure, which seemingly delays Danish-learning children in several aspects of their language acquisition. Adult language use appears to be affected as well, resulting, among other things, in an increased dependence on top-down information in comprehension. In this conceptual review, we build the argument that a causal relationship may exist between the sound structure of Danish and the peculiarities of its acquisition and use. We argue that a theory of language learning that accommodates the existing evidence from Danish must explicitly account for the interaction between learner-related factors and language-specific constraints.},

Teachers with voice disorders demonstrated higher median scores in VHI-30 total scale and functional, physical, and emotional subscales (P{$<$}0.001). In teachers, voice disorders have a more significant impact on their physical comfort and have a smaller impact on their emotional sphere. 76.4\% of the voice disorder group respondents acquired the total score within 12 to 33 points. In the control group, 75.3\% of teachers had the VHI score of up to 17 points. Conclusions: In teacher population of Latvia mild voice disorders are encountered more often. Activity and participation in everyday life situations are limited in teachers with voice disorders. Voice disorders mostly impact physical comfort in teachers.},

In Aylett’s proposal, information that enables lis­ teners to identify sequences of elements in an utterance (signal redundancy) comes from two sources: a) language redundancy, recognition likelihood based on lex­ ical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and other factors, and b) acoustic redundancy, recognition likelihood based on acoustic salience. Smooth signal redundancy is achieved by a complementary relationship between language redundancy and acoustic redundancy that is implemented via prosodic structure.},

The speech described here is that of one of the authors, Merton Sandoval of Dulce, New Mexico. The Apachean group is comprised of Western Apachean (Navajo; the Western Apache dialects Cibecue, San Carlos, and White Mountain; and Chiricahua and Mescalero) Eastern Apachean (Jicarilla, Lipan) and Plains Apache (formerly called Kiowa Apache). The other major groups of Athabaskan languages include the northern group of languages spoken in Alaska and Canada, and the Pacific Coast group spoken in Oregon and California. While the western Apachean languages have a well-documented member in Navajo, the eastern group is less well known, being best documented so far in the works of Goddard (1911), Hoijer (1938, 1945, 1946a, 1946b) and Jung (1999). Differences between the western and eastern groups concentrate in consonant development and the evolution of stem shape, and, to some extent, in the lexicon; however, Jicarilla resembles all other Athabaskan languages in bearing a close morphological relationship to all its relatives.},

  abstract = {Ika is a dialect of the Igbo language spoken in Ika South and Ika North East Local Government Areas of Delta State and the Igbanke area of Edo State in Nigeria. It belongs to the Niger Igbo cluster of dialects (Ikekeonwu 1986) spoken in areas bordering the west of the River Niger; Nwaozuzu (2008) refers to these dialects as West Niger Group of Dialects. A word list of Ika, written by Williamson (1968), was one of the earliest works on Ika and she points out in that work that Ika (and Ukwuani), though regarded as dialects of Igbo, are treated as separate on purely linguistic grounds. Ika phonology differs from that of Standard Igbo and other Igbo dialects and this is why the study of Ika has been of major interest to Igbo linguists in recent years. There have been moves to grant Ika a language status, as seen in the assignment of a unique reference code to Ika: the ISO language code for Ika is ISO 639–3 ikk while that for Igbo is ISO 639–3 ibo. Standard Igbo has the same consonants as Ika though the latter has two consonants, /ʃ/and/ʒ/, which do not exist in the Standard dialect. However, the vocalic system of Ika is largely different from that of Standard and some Igbo dialects which have eight vowels. Ika has a nine-vowel system which includes the schwa, which is a variant of some vowels. Furthermore, it has nine nasal vowels; Standard Igbo and other dialects of Igbo have no nasal vowels. Ika manifests intonation in addition to lexical tone. Standard Igbo and other Igbo dialects do not manifest intonation in the same way as Ika does; that is, they do not express attitudes and emotions through intonation. They manifest only lexical tone. In an earlier study of Northern Igbo dialects, Ikekeonwu (1986) could only discover the existence of upstep in Abakaliki dialect. Okorji (1991) and Egbeji (1999) have studied the intonation of Umuchu, an inland West dialect of Igbo. Their findings, particularly Egbeji’s, show that a declarative sentence can be changed to an interrogative one (repetitive question) by use of intonation. This is a syntactic function which can also be likened to what happens in Standard and most other Igbo dialects where the tone of the pronominal subject changes from high to low in the indication of interrogation. At present, therefore, there appears to be no evidence that attitudes and emotions can be expressed through intonation in Umuchu and other Igbo dialects as is observed in Ika.},

  abstract = {Rhotics are generally believed to be phonetically heterogeneous. Ladefoged and Maddieson [11, pg 245] stated that the only true unity of rhotics “seems to rest mostly on the historical connections between these subgroups and on the choice of the letter ‘r’ to represent them all”. However, there are some generalizations to be made for all r-sounds regarding phonological behaviour, phonotactic properties, and synchronic and diachronic alternations [12, 1, 27]. For German /r/ realisation a large segmental variation has been described in the literature leading some authors to conclude that a positive description of the German phoneme /r/ does not make sense [10]. /r/ produced by German speakers has previously been described in comprehensive corpora and /r/ was found to have undergone dramatic changes. An investigation carried out in the early 1970s showed that /r/ in the syllable rhyme was realised most frequently as a trill or a fricative. More recent studies have shown that /r/ was realised mainly as rhotacized vowels (or vocalised /r/ terms here used synonymously) [24]. The present paper (i) provides evidence that the process of /r/ vocalisation is independent of regional variation and spreads from the north to the south in the German speaking countries in Central Europe and (ii) investigates the allophonic alternation of trills and taps and their interaction with prosodic structure using cross-varietal data from two standard varieties (henceforth SV) of German spoken in Switzerland and Austria.},

Objective: To study various morphologies of soft palate, difference in proportion of each type and their differencesamong gender and agegroups in Nepalese sample. Materials \& Method: Aretrospective study was conducted on patients seeking orthodontic treatment. 263 lateral cephalograms were classified on the basis of radiographic appearance. Analysis was done using SPSS (version 20.0). Pearson chi square and descriptive statistics were performed and level of significance was set at p{$<$}0.05. Result: In the order of occurrence; rat tail type of soft palate was most prevalent followed by leaf type, butt type, straightline, crooked type and S shaped. There was no significant difference between male and female subjects (p=0.338) and through age groups (p=0.998). Conclusion: The study highlights various types of soft palate present in Nepalese sample which will help as a reference for research pertaining to cleft palate/ velopharyngeal closure and in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in Nepalese population.},

  abstract = {The first decades of the 21st century have witnessed a renewed interest in the relationship between language structure and the various social and ecological niches in which the languages of the world are used and against the background of which they evolved. In this context, Everett (2013) argued for direct geographical influences on the sound structure of languages. It was observed that ejective consonants, produced with a sudden burst of non-pulmonic air to a salient acoustic effect, tend to occur in high-altitude environments in which these sounds may be adaptive due to a reduced articulatory effort and/or to prevent desiccation. Here, we evaluate this claim and at the same time place it into a broader context. We observe that the distribution of another class of typologically unusual sounds, uvulars, is highly similar to that of ejectives, but that the proposed explanations are not available to account for the similar geographical patterning of uvulars. Hence, we test an alternative explanatory account that would posit indirect rather than direct environmental influences on language structure that are mediated by anthropological factors, in particular the relative sociolinguistic isolation of speech communities at the highest altitudes. Applying Bayesian Logistic Mixed Effects Regression to a large database of phonological inventories of the world’s languages, however, we do not find strong support for either a correlation of ejectives or uvulars with high-altitude environments, though the association is somewhat stronger for ejectives than uvulars. A phylogenetic exploration of the development of both classes of sounds in two large language families spoken in widely different environments, Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan, together with a qualitative assessment of the dedicated literature, in contrast, suggests a strong role of language contact rather than environmental factors.},

  abstract = {Studies of variation in continuous speech converge towards the conclusion that in everyday speech, words are often produced with reduced variants: some segments are shortened or completely absent. We describe an initiative to automatically exploit spoken corpora, in order to better understand linguistic behavior in spontaneous speech. This study focuses on the reduction of the postposed definite article in Romanian. The Romanian corpora used here cover several speaking styles including both prepared and spontaneous speech, such as broadcast news and debates, elicited dialogues and monologues on suggested topics. Taken together, the data sets contain more than 10 hours of speech produced in a variety of communicative frameworks. The deletion of the definite article -l, i.e. L-dropping in continuous speech, is investigated across speaking styles using pronunciation variants aligned with the speech. The main question addressed in the study is the influence of speaking style on the distribution of L-dropping. We examine the role of the surrounding context in L-dropping and L-retention. The results show that, in prepared speech and broadcast news, deletion is triggered by the context as a consequence of the communicative framework and the nature of the following segment (following vowel-initial words favor L-retention, while consonant-initial words favor L-dropping). In spontaneous speech, L-dropping is more frequent and the context is less important in predicting the occurrence of reduced variants than in other speaking styles.},

A broader definition and an overview of the psychoacoustic correlates of the auditory roughness sensation, also referred to as sensory dissonance, is followed by an examination of efforts to quantify it over the past one hundred and fifty years and leads to the introduction of a new roughness calculation model and an application that automates spectral and roughness analysis of sound signals. Implementation of spectral and roughness analysis is briefly discussed in the context of two pilot perceptual experiments, designed to assess the relationship among cultural background, music performance practice, and aesthetic attitudes towards the auditory roughness sensation.},

According to Belemans, Kruijsen \& Van Keymeulen (1998), the dialect of Hamont belongs to the West Limburg dialects (subclassification: Dommellands). Limburg dialects occupy a unique position among the Belgian and Dutch dialects in that their prosodic system has a lexical tone distinction, which is traditionally referred to as               SLEEPTOON               ‘dragging tone’ and               STOOTTOON               ‘push tone’. In line with recent conventions, stoottoon is referred to as Accent 1 and transcribed as superscript 1; sleeptoon is referred to as Accent 2 and is transcribed as superscript 2 (cf. Schmidt 1986).},

This variety is the same as what is commonly referred to internationally as ‘Flemish’. However, the term ‘Flemish’ is avoided here since it erroneously suggests that this language is different from the one spoken in the Netherlands: the lexical and syntactic differences between the two language varieties are very small. Nevertheless, there are significant phonetic differences as well as substantial regional variability within the two speech communities.},

Neighbouring languages are the Middle Paman language Umpithamu, along the coast to the north (see, for instance, Verstraete 2010, 2012) and two Lamalamic languages, Rimanggudinhma to the southwest (located inland; Godman 1993, Sommer 1999b), and Lamalama to the southeast (along the coast; Sommer 1999a).},

In spontaneous and elicited speech, ten distinct rhotic variants, subsequently recoded into five categories, were observed and quantified. Moreover, approximant and assibilated variants have notable frequencies and conditioning factors.

Visual recalibration of auditory speech identification: a McGurk aftereffect. Psychol. Sci. 14 (2003) 592–597). When an ambiguous sound intermediate between /aba/ and /ada/ was dubbed onto a face articulating /aba/ (or /ada/), the proportion of responses consistent with the visual stimulus increased in subsequent unimodal auditory sound identification trials, revealing recalibration. In contrast, when an unambiguous /aba/ or /ada/ sound was dubbed onto the face (with no conflict between vision and audition), the proportion of responses decreased, revealing selective adaptation. In the present study we show that recalibration and selective adaptation not only differ in the direction of their aftereffects, but also that they dissipate at different rates, confirming that the effects are caused by different mechanisms.},

The long-distance nature of nasal harmony can be met by the transmission of nasalization either to a series of segments or to a non-adjacent segment. Nasal harmony usually occurs within words or a smaller domain, either morphologically or prosodically defined. This chapter introduces the chief characteristics of nasal harmony patterns with exemplification, and highlights related theoretical themes. It focuses primarily on the different roles that segments can play in nasal harmony, and the typological properties to which they give rise. The following terminological conventions will be assumed. A trigger is a segment that initiates nasal harmony. A target is a segment that undergoes harmony. An opaque segment or blocker halts nasal harmony. A transparent segment is one that does not display nasalization within a span of nasal harmony, but does not halt harmony from transmitting beyond it.},

This study aimed to evaluate (a) the association between ankyloglossia and speech disorders, and (b) the effectiveness of surgical interventions on the articulation of patients with ankyloglossia. Material and Methods A comprehensive search of PubMed was conducted. Randomized control trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case-control studies, and case series with over five cases were included. Result Of the 16 included studies, except for one cross-sectional study, all studies were small in sample size. The evidence quality was generally low, with an average of 3.88 in a 7-point system. Three studies investigated the occurrence of speech disorders in the ankyloglossia population and obtained different results. Fifteen studies assessed the effectiveness of surgery, among which eight self-control studies observed significant postoperative improvement, whereas three of four cohort studies with untreated controls reported no significant differences. Three RCTs compared surgical techniques and one pointed out the advantage of frenuloplasty over frenulotomy. Conclusion There was no clear connection between ankyloglossia and speech disorders. More widely accepted uniform grading systems and well-designed clinical studies are needed.},

We investigate a large drop in F4 which sometimes occurs in conjunction with the flap in American English. The goal of the present work is to document this phenomenon, and to determine what phonological environments coincide with this large drop in F4. We measure data from six speakers producing words with medial flaps in various environments, such as party, turtle, bottle, credit, harder. We find that the combination of flap with a rhotic and to a lesser extend a syllabic / / leads to a larger drop in F4 than other flap combinations like a following /i/. Together with previous perceptual data, the findings support the conclusion that this feature of F4 results from transitions among articulations.},

LE itself is said to have developed in the middle of the 19th century, after rapid immigration from Ireland during the Irish potato famines of 1845–1847 (see Knowles 1973). Arguably as a result of this immigration, as we will see, there are some similarities between LE's phonological system and those of Irish Englishes. Of course, as we might expect, the phonological system of LE maintains its connection with other northern Englishes, too.},

The proposal is shown to be compatible with antecedent analyses and data from regional forms and registers.},

The resulting particulate model of category contents allows the application of evolution theory in modeling category change, because variation in categorized percepts is reflected in the distribution of exemplars in a category. Within a production-perception feedback loop, variation within an exemplar-based category provides a reserve of variants that can serve as the seeds for shifts in the system over time through random or selection-driven asymmetries in production and perception. Here, three potential pathways for evolutionary change are identified in linguistic categories: pruning of lines of inheritance, blending inheritance and natural selection. Simulations of each of these pathways are shown within a simple exemplar-based model of category production and perception, showing how consideration of evolutionary processes may contribute to our understanding of linguistic category change over time.},

  abstract = {Phonetic aspects of many languages have been documented, though the breadth and focus of such documentation varies substantially. In this survey, phonetic aspects (here called ‘categories’) that are typically reported were assessed in three English-language collections – the Illustrations of the IPA from the Journal of the International Phonetic Association, articles from the Journal of Phonetics, and papers from the Ladefoged/Maddieson Sounds of the World’s Languages (SOWL) documentation project. Categories were defined for consonants (e.g. Voice Onset Time (VOT) and frication spectrum; 10 in total), vowels (e.g. formants and duration; 7 in total) and suprasegmentals (e.g. stress and distinctive vowel length, 6 in total). The Illustrations, due to their brevity, had, on average, limited coverage of the selected categories (12\% of the 23 categories). Journal of Phonetics articles were typically theoretically motivated, but 64 had sufficient measurements to count as phonetic documentation; these also covered 12\% of the categories. The SOWL studies, designed to cover as much of the phonetic structure as feasible in an article-length treatment, achieved 41\% coverage on average. Four book-length studies were also examined, with an average of 49\% coverage. Phonetic properties of many language families have been studied, though Indo-European is still disproportionately represented. Physiological measures were excluded as being less common, and perceptual measures were excluded as being typically more theoretical. This preliminary study indicates that certain acoustic properties of languages are typically measured and may be considered as an impetus for later, fuller coverage, but broader consensus on the categories is needed. Current and future documentation efforts would benefit these considerations being addressed.},

Applying GWAS to multivariate shape phenotypes, we identified 203 genomic regions associated with normal-range facial variation, 117 of which are novel. The associated regions are enriched for both genes relevant to craniofacial and limb morphogenesis and enhancer activity in cranial neural crest cells and craniofacial tissues. Genetic variants grouped by their contribution to similar aspects of facial variation show high within-group correlation of enhancer activity, and four SNP pairs display evidence of epistasis, indicating potentially coordinated actions of variants within the same cell types or tissues. In sum, our analyses provide new insights for understanding how complex morphological traits are shaped by both individual and coordinated genetic actions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Structuralists famously observed that language is “un systême oû tout se tient” (Meillet, 1903, p. 407), insisting that the system of relations of linguistic units was more important than their concrete content. This study attempts to derive content from relations, in particular phonetic (acoustic) content from the distribution of alternative pronunciations used in different geographical varieties. It proceeds from data documenting language variation, examining six dialect atlases each containing the phonetic transcriptions of the same sets of words at hundreds of different sites. We obtain the sound segment correspondences via an alignment procedure, and then apply an information-theoretic measure, pointwise mutual information, assigning smaller segment distances to sound segment pairs which correspond relatively frequently. We iterate alignment and information-theoretic distance assignment until both remain stable, and we evaluate the quality of the resulting phonetic distances by comparing them to acoustic vowel distances. Wieling, Margaretha, and Nerbonne (2011) evaluated this method on the basis of Dutch and German dialect data, and here we provide more general support for the method by applying it to several other dialect datasets (i.e. Gabon Bantu, U.S. English, Tuscan and Bulgarian). We find relatively strong significant correlations between the induced phonetic distances and the acoustic distances, illustrating the usefulness of the method in deriving valid phonetic distances from distributions of dialectal variation.},

In four studies, we show the pattern to be extremely robust, being the first widespread pattern of iconicity documented not just across a large, diverse sample of the world’s spoken languages, but also across numerous sensory words within languages. Our deep analysis of Indo-European languages and Proto-Indo-European roots indicates remarkable historical stability of the pattern, which appears to date back at least 6000~years.},

Studies of Chinese-speaking children challenge these assumptions. For example, Chinese-speaking children can produce tones before two-and-a-half years but are not able to discriminate the same tones until after 6 years of age. This study compared the perception and production of monosyllabic Cantonese tones directly in 3 -year-old children. Twenty children and their mothers identified Cantonese tones in a picture identification test and produced monosyllabic tones in a picture labeling task. To control for lexical biases on tone ratings, the mother- and child-productions were low-pass filtered to eliminate lexical information and were presented to five judges for tone classification. Detailed acoustic analysis was performed. Contrary to the view that children master lexical tones earlier than segmental phonemes, results showed that 3-year-old children could not perceive or produce any Cantonese tone with adult-like proficiency and incorrect tone productions were acoustically different from criterion. In contrast to previous findings that Cantonese-speaking children mastered tone production before tone perception, we observed more accuracy during speech perception than production. Findings from Cantonese-speaking children challenge some of the established tenets in theories of phonological development that have been tested mostly with native English speakers.},

Methods. A total of 180 healthy Korean-speaking adult volunteers, who had no nasal or voice-related complaints, were enrolled in this study. Nasometry, acoustic rhinometry, and rhinomanometry were performed to obtain the nasalance score, nasal cavity volume, and nasal resistance, respectively. Changes in these parameters with age were analyzed. Results. Nasal cavity volume increased significantly, and nasal resistance decreased significantly, with age. The nasalance scores for the nasal passage and oronasal passage decreased significantly with age, while there were no age-related changes in nasalance scores for the oral passage. Conclusion. Nasalance scores for the passages containing nasal consonants decreased with age although significant increases were observed in nasal cavity volume and nasal patency with age. Therefore, the age-related decreases in nasalance scores may result from factors other than changes in the nasal cavity.},

The classification of Ladin within Western Romance has been the subject of a long-lasting scientific and at times ideological debate, particularly because at the end of the 19th century the region was contested between the new-born Italian state and the Habsburg empire. The varieties of Ladin share phonetic-phonological, morphological, syntactic and lexical features with the other languages spoken in the Central-Eastern Alps, such as Friulian and Romansh, thus leading to the identification of the Rhaeto-Romance group (Haiman \& Benincà 1992). However, in Ladin there are still many linguistic phenomena that connect it to the Romance dialects of Northern Italy. Therefore, a clear assignment of Ladin to a group is by no means a simple and uncontroversial operation (Salvi 2016).},

The aim of our study was to investigate the variation of the velar morphology. Methods: In this study, the sample comprised 200 normal subjects whose ages ranged from 5–48 years (mean 19.37 years). The morphology of the soft palate on lateral cephalometry was examined and classified into six types. The dimensional differences of the soft palate between each pair of types and the differences in proportion to different age and gender groups were also studied. Results: The morphology of the soft palate was classified into six types. There was a significant difference between the pre-adult and adult groups and also between male and female groups in proportion to velar type. The velar length in Type 3 was significantly shorter than in all other types apart from Type 6. However, there was no significant difference between any two of the other 5 types. Conclusions: The soft palate has variable radiographic appearances on lateral cephalometry. The classification system and statistical findings here may help the research of velopharyngeal closure in cleft palate individuals, and aetiological study of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and other conditions.},

The goals of the study are two-fold: to provide a thorough description of the phonetic variation in the word-initial liquid in these two dialects and to examine the acquisition of Seoul Korean features by North Koreans residing in Seoul. The participants were prompted to produce initial liquids by reading a list of Sino-Korean words in North Korean orthography and loanwords that begin with a liquid. We found that in addition to tap, the presumed default variant in word-initial position, a variety of variants (nasal, lateral, approximant, obstruent, and trill) are attested in both North and South Korean speakers’ speech, but the proportion of the variants differ by dialect; Northern Hamkyeong speakers produced more obstruent and trill variants than Seoul Korean speakers, while Seoul Korean speakers produced more lateral and approximant variants. We also found evidence for dialect-internal changes and dialect acquisition. The younger Seoul Korean speakers realized the word-initial liquid as lateral more than older speakers, and the use of trill is declining in the North Korean dialect with younger speakers using it less than older speakers. The North Korean speakers who have been in South Korea longer and have the most contact with South Korean speakers tend to produce fewer obstruents.},

Data from twelve sociolinguistic interviews with men and women of different ages were analyzed acoustically with Praat and classified as the canonical trill or a different variant. Each token was then coded according to the following linguistic and extralinguistic factors: following vowel backness, position of /r/ in the word, grammatical category, number of syllables, syllable stress, corpus frequency, number of phonological neighbors, speaker age, and speaker sex. Results revealed that stressed syllables and the middle and older age groups favored the canonical trilled variant. Word-medial position and wordinitial position after a consonant also favored the trill, while word-initial after a vowel or a pause disfavored the trill. Corpus frequency was negatively correlated with canonical /r/ production, i.e. higher frequency disfavored trills, while number of phonological neighbors was positively correlated, i.e. words with more phonological neighbors favored the trill. These findings suggest that future research should define word position in more detail and also consider corpus frequency and phonological neighborhood as variables.},

  abstract = {The current study investigates correlations between individual differences in the production of nasal coarticulation and patterns of perceptual compensation in American English. A production study (Experiment 1) assessed participants’ nasal coarticulation repertoires by eliciting productions of CVC, CVN and NVN words. Stimuli for two perception tasks were created by cross-splicing oral vowels (from C\_C words), nasal vowels (from C\_N words), and hypernasal vowels (from N\_N words) into C\_C, C\_N, and N\_N consonant contexts. Stimuli pairs were presented to listeners in a paired discrimination task (Experiment 2), where similarity of vowels was assessed, and a nasality ratings task (Experiment 3), where relative nasalization of vowels was judged. In the discrimination task, individual differences in produced nasal coarticulation predicted patterns of veridical acoustic perception. Individuals who produce less extensive anticipatory nasal coarticulation exhibit more veridical acoustic perception (indicating less compensation for coarticulation) than individuals who produce greater coarticulatory nasality. However, in the ratings task, listeners’ produced nasal coarticulation did not predict perceptual patterns. Rather, more veridical perceptual response patterns were observed across participants in context-inappropriate coarticulatory conditions, i.e., for hypernasal vowels in C\_N contexts (e.g. bẽn) and nasal vowels in N\_N contexts (e.g. mẽn). The results of this study suggest a complex and multifaceted relationship between representations used to produce and perceive speech.},
